<p>Want to make the best blueberry pie you've ever had, and don't want to spend all 
day in the kitchen combing the Internet or studying overly 
complicated recipes? Anyway, this pie is so easy and has stood the test of time.&nbsp; What makes it different 
from other blueberry pies is: it's mostly 
blueberries, not crust or sugar; and the combination of spices is superb!&nbsp; And 
it doesn't matter if you're not a chef or have never made a pie before! Following these 
illustrated directions ANYONE can cook a perfect blueberry pie! </p>

	<h3>Step 1&nbsp; - Make the pie crust</h3>
	<p>Never made a crust, either?&nbsp; Fear&nbsp; not, they are really simple.&nbsp;
	<a target="_blank" href="piecrust.php">Click here for instructions about 
	making a flour pie crust.</a> It will open in a new window, so just close the new 
	window to return here. I prefer blueberry pie in a 
	<a target="_top" href="grahamcrust.php">graham cracker 
	crust</a>; click on the link for directions. .Now is also a good time to get the oven preheating to 
	375 
	F. 
		
	<h3>	Step 2- Wash the blueberries</h3>
	<p> 
		
	<img border="0" src="blueberry/blueberries_wash.jpg" width="303" height="230" align="left" alt="Blueberries">Just rinse them in a colander or sieve in cold water, no soap.
	<img border="0" src="blueberry/blueberries_sort.jpg" width="274" height="203" align="right"><p>Pick out and remove any bits of stems, leaves and soft or mushy 
	berries. It is easiest to do this in a large bowl of water and gently run 
	your hands through the berries as they float.&nbsp; With 
	your fingers slightly apart, you will easily feel any soft or mushy berries 
	get caught in your fingers.

<p>&nbsp;<h3>	Step 3 - Mix the dry filling ingredients.</h3>
	<p>
	<img border="0" src="blueberry/bbpsugarfl.jpg" width="300" height="207" align="left"><img border="0" src="blueberry/bbpsugarmixed.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="right">Combine the 
	2/3 cup sugar (or sugar/Splenda blend), 7 Tablespoons of corn starch in a bowl&nbsp; 
	and mix well!&nbsp; Some people like 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and/or 1/4 
	teaspoon of allspice, mixed in, also. That's optional, but it is nice!<p>&nbsp;<h3>Step 4&nbsp; - Mix in the liquids</h3>
	<p>
	<img border="0" src="blueberry/bbpsugarjuice.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left">Add 
	the 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice, and 3 Tablespoons of water (or grape 
	juice) and stir it up. If you use Splenda, it will be pretty gloppy, rather than drier crumbs, but it still works the same!<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<h3>	Step 5 - Add the blueberries to the 
pie crust</h3>
	<p>

	<img border="0" src="blueberry/bbpberrieswsugar.jpg" width="300" height="214" align="left">Add the blueberries 
	to the pie crust.&nbsp; Just pour them in!&nbsp; There's lots of air space and it will cook down, so don't worry if they 
	mound up about an inch (2.5 cm) above the edge of the plate.
	<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Step 6 - Pour the liquid mix into the pie</h3>
	<p></p>

	<img border="0" src="blueberry/bbpieincrust.jpg" width="313" height="217" align="left">Just pour the mixture 
	of sugar, juice, etc. into the pie all over the blueberries. If it is a 
gloppy liquid, dont worry, just pour it somewhat evenly over the top. But it 
doesnt take perfection; it will smooth itself out in the oven.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<h3>Step 
	7 - Make and add your topping</h3>
	<p></p>

	<img border="0" src="blueberry/bbpready.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="right"><img border="0" src="blueberry/bbpiecrumb.jpg" width="328" height="258" align="left">If you want the crumb topping, just mix 
<p>&nbsp;- 1/4 cup sugar (OR 1/8 cup sugar and 1/8 cup Splenda)</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup flour</p>
<p>&nbsp;- 1/4 cup butter or margarine</p>
	<p>&nbsp;together in a small bowl and sprinkle it over the pie.</p>
	<p>If you want to the dough topping instead, roll out a circular section of 
	dough that you made in step 1, to 1/8 inch thick, then place it over the 
	pie.&nbsp; Seal it against the edges with the pie crust, and make decorative 
	slits with a knife. </p>
	<h3>	Step 
	8 - Put the pie in the oven!</h3>
	<p>
	<img border="0" src="blueberry/bbpieinoven.jpg" width="307" height="230" align="left">Cook the pie at 375 F (or 190 Celsius) for 1 hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Step 
	9 - Remove when the pie is golden and pie is bubbling</h3>
	<p>Check to see if it is bubbling and crust is golden brown. If if not, 
	check every 3 or 4 minutes until it is.<h3>	Step 
	10 - Enjoy!</h3>
	<p>
	<img border="0" src="blueberry/bbpdone.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left">Set the pie on a rack to cool and enjoy! Here is a slice of the finished pie!&nbsp;Serve 
	warm with ice cream.&nbsp; Refrigerate after it is cooled. 
	It easily lasts a week in the fridge (that is, if there is no one there to 
	eat it. Most of the time, people eat it all within a day!)<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><hr>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If you use frozen berries, it helps to sprinkle 3 tablespoons of corn starch 
in pie crust/pan just before you add the blueberries!&nbsp; That helps to 
	suck up any additional liquid, so the pie won't be runny.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments and feedback</h2>
<p>

		Here's what some visitors had to say:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on November 26, 2010:</b> &quot;I found your recipe for 
	making a blueberry pie a few days ago and since I was making that as one of 
	my Thanksgiving pies, I decided to try it. Now, my 85 year old 
	grandmother(Nana)makes the best pies, hands down. I learned from her and 
	every Thanksgiving, I try new recipes to go with old favorites. Well, my 
	Nana tried a piece of my blueberry pie and insisted on having the recipe! 
	She is thrilled that she can completely skip cooking and thickening the 
	blueberries first. I have to say that everyone was extremely impressed. 
	Thank you for the greatest &amp; easiest blueberry pie recipe! I'm trying the
	<a href="pumpkinpie.php" target="_top">pumpkin pie</a> one next.&quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on November 18, 2010:</b> &quot;I found this website by 
	going to Google and I typed in &quot;World's Best Blue Berry Pie&quot; and let me just 
	say it sure is. We picked fresh blueberries this past summer and froze them 
	and I couldn't decide what to make with them, so when I was asked to bring a 
	pie to Thanksgiving this year I started in on the research. I thought this 
	recipe was super easy. I went with the Graham Cracker crust and it was the 
	best I have ever had. along with the crumb topping everyone was amazed. I 
	made a sample one first and took it to my work and everyone loved it. This 
	recipe is going in the family cook book for sure. Thanks so much for an 
	amazing recipe.&quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on June 08, 2010:</b> &quot;I just made the &quot;World's Best 
	Blueberry Pie&quot; and it sure lived up to its name! It was FANTASTIC!!! I have 
	made good blueberry pies before, but none have met this one! Everyone loved 
	it. I made it with a double crust, latticing the top. I used the crust 
	recipe that you have, and that was the best crust I've ever made! THANK YOU! 
	THANK YOU! THANK YOU! I did two things that I did that helped. After I 
	washed the berries I put them in the salad spinner and that helped get rid 
	of any excess water. Then due to the climate that I live in, I put a bunch 
	of ice in a large zipper bag, and chill my granite counter top before I roll 
	out dough. This worked well to help keep the dough cold. &quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on October 29, 2009:</b> &quot;I just wanted to thank you 
	for the best blueberry pie recipe ever. I have only been baking my own pies 
	for three years (next month will be my third Thanksgiving) and this recipe 
	has been the biggest hit. My family has actually fought over who got to take 
	the leftovers home. Before, my father would have only one slice a year, but 
	now I end up baking him at least 3 whole pies between Thanksgiving and 
	Christmas. &quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on October 03, 2009:</b> &quot;This was the best 
	blueberry pie i had ever made. I usually don't like blueberries, but my 
	family does, and they all loved it, and so did I. I followed the recipe and 
	it came out perfectly, also I recommend the crumb top because the dough top 
	can be a little overwhelming.&quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on September 15, 2009:</b> &quot;Skeptically I followed 
	your pie crust recipe which was included with the blueberry pie. The recipe 
	is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing it, which I just did with one 
	of my close friends after she and her husband had tasted it. Keep up the 
	wonderful site. Pat </li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on August 21, 2009:</b> &quot;Loved your recipe it was so 
	simple and just what I was looking for. Now I can enjoy my blueberries that 
	I grow. I used raw sugar and it worked excellent I also have a gas well so I 
	put the crock in the oven on keep warm worked out just fine. thank you for 
	sharing it.&quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on September 01, 2009:</b> &quot;Here in the Upper 
	Peninsula of Michigan we have an abundance of wild blueberries. I just 
	wanted to say that this is a very easy and delicious pie recipe. I have made 
	it 4 times in the last two weeks. My family loves it! To make it even easier 
	I have been using a frozen crust already in the pan and then using a 
	Pillsbury refrigerated crust for the top crust. It makes it a lot easier to 
	whip a pie together to bring somewhere for dessert. And everybody is 
	impressed with the fabulous homemade pie!&quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on August 08, 2009:</b> &quot;I LOVE the Blueberry Pie 
	recipe!!!! I made it for a dinner with friends and have been making it EVERY 
	week since! The recipe is so simple and inexpensive. I'm a pretty novice 
	chef, so I was amazed that I could create something this delicious! Thank 
	you so much! &quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on July 27, 2009:</b> &quot;Wonderful Pie! Even the 
	children LOVED it! I had to make another pie the very next day! I bought a 
	double deep dish pie crust and used the extra to make a crust on top with 
	six slits to allow steam to expel. Perfect pie every time and simple recipe 
	too!!!&quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on July 26, 2009:</b> &quot;That is truly the best 
	blueberry pie recipe I have ever tried. Thanks&quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on July 18, 2009:</b> &quot;I made the blueberry pie and 
	the whole family loved it. I used the graham cracker crust and have a tip to 
	make it even easier. Just buy an extra pie crust. Put in in a baggie and 
	crush it up. Use this as your topping.&quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on March 17, 2009:</b> &quot;This is in regards to your 
	blueberry pie recipe. I had some frozen blueberries in the freezer. They 
	have been there for awhile. I also had to already made pie tin doughs from 
	the store. I was searching for something quick and easy to make my husband 
	for that night. I wanted to use up those blueberries, and pie doughs. They 
	have been in the freezer too long : ) Your recipe was quick, simple, and 
	tasted FANTASTIC! My husband was so excited to try them when he saw them in 
	the fridge. (I made two) He said it was the best blueberry pie he ever had! 
	He also said it was even better than than the ones in the store or 
	restaurants we have been to! I did not have the 5 spice so I just added the 
	cinnamon and it turned out great anyway. I can't wait to get fresh 
	blueberries and try this recipe again. I am sure it will taste even better! 
	Thank you so much for this recipe. It was packed full of blueberries and not 
	runny stayed together. Really great! Will make again and again and again! &quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on August 27, 2008:</b> &quot;Made the blueberry pie with 
	the graham cracker crust and struesel and have to say this was the first 
	time I have ever had a blueberry pie that actually had a lot of fruit in it, 
	not just thickened juice, and it was able to hold its shape, it didn't run 
	all over the plate. As to taste, my wife and I both agree it was the best we 
	have ever had. Can't wait to try the
	<a target="_top" href= "http://www.pumpkinpatchesandmore.org/pumpkinpie.php">
	fresh pumpkin pie recipe</a>. Thanks for the recipe, it will get used often.

	<li><b>A visitor writes on July 13, 2008:</b> &quot;I just tried your blueberry 
	pie recipe and it was AWESOME!!! Thank you so much. We had a BBQ tonight and 
	the pie was the hit of the evening. (I picked the blueberries from a farm in 
	Indiana, but we also have many great farms here in Michigan as well.)&quot;</li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on July 13, 2008:</b> &quot;I have to tell you, this 
	website has been a huge help. I haven't gardened in a few years and now 
	that we've moved out of town so I have some space to play, I've been busy 
	canning and freezing. The information you provide has been wonderful. The 
	blueberry pie was a huge hit at our family Fourth of July gathering. I even 
	took your blueberry jam recipe, made some modifications with it, and made a 
	mixed berry jam with blueberries, blackberries, and wild cherry infusion for 
	the liquid. </li>
	<li><b>A visitor writes on June 22, 2008:</b> &quot;I made your recipe w/1/2 the 
	sugar and lemon zest w/incredible results...do you think I could follow the 
	recipe w/frozen blackberries w/the same wonderful results? I made the 
	blueberry pie for a neighbor who frequents Maine and he said it was better 
	than anything he has had in Maine. &quot;<br>
	Blake - Yep, it works great with blackberries, too</li>

	<b>A visitor writes on May 31, 2008:</b> &quot;I LOVE your 
	recipe for 'the best blueberry pie' and use is regularly.&nbsp; Just recently my 
	partner was diagnosed with diabetes so now I look at the 'total carbs' on 
	all things.&nbsp; I was wondering if you have that information, I DID notice the 
	'splenda' &amp; sugar mix, which I am going to use today.&nbsp; &quot;</li>
	<li>
	<b>A visitor writes on March 3, 2008:</b> &quot;Thank you for your Blueberry 
	pie web page (<a href= "http://pickyourown.org/blueberrypie.php) ">http://pickyourown.org/blueberrypie.php)&nbsp;</a>and 
	recipe. I made my first blueberry pie ever in February using your recipe.&nbsp;I 
	used 3 cups of Blueberries plus I added 1/2 cup of raspberries. My wife was 
	thrilled with the results (except for the extra calories to her waist 
	line).&quot;</li>
