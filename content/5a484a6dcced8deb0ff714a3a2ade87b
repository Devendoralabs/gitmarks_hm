<title>The First Smiley :-)</title>

<h2>The First Smiley :-)</h2>
<p>The smiley :-) and its many variants are an important (and fun!) part of the worldwide
online social culture -- allowing emotions to be conveyed in plain text.&nbsp;
It has been in widespread use since the early '80s, when it was first
proposed.&nbsp; Yet the original message in which the smiley was invented had
been lost -- until now. :-)&nbsp; After a significant effort to locate it, on
September 10, 2002 the original post made by Scott Fahlman on CMU CS general
bboard was retrieved by Jeff Baird from an October 1982 backup tape of the spice
vax (cmu-750x).&nbsp; Here is Scott's original post:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>19-Sep-82 11:44    Scott E  Fahlman             :-)
From: Scott E  Fahlman &lt;Fahlman at Cmu-20c&gt;

I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers:

:-)

Read it sideways.  Actually, it is probably more economical to mark
things that are NOT jokes, given current trends.  For this, use

:-(</pre>

<p><b>Credits:</b>&nbsp; Many people were involved in this computing
archaeology success story.&nbsp; I (Mike Jones) kicked off the effort in February
2002 by looking through some old bboard program (Bags) sources, figuring out the
filename that the post would likely be found under (/usr/cmu/lib/bb/general.bb),
and asking Howard Wactlar, the former CMU SCS facilities director, whether the
file could still be restored.&nbsp; Scott Fahlman provided data narrowing the
probable span of time during which the post was made.&nbsp; Howard and Bob
Cosgrove, the current director, determined that backup tapes from that period
(1981-1983) still existed and asked Jeff Baird of the facilities staff to try to
find and restore the post.&nbsp; Dave Livingston of facilities located a working
9-track tape drive and a machine to use it on. Kirk Berthold and Michael Riley
in CS operations managed retrieving tapes from off-site archival storage.&nbsp;
Grad student Dan Pelleg's FreeBSD machine was used to read the 4.1BSD dump
format tapes using a compatibility mode in the restore program. (Later in the
effort a NetBSD machine was used to do the same thing.)&nbsp; Dale Moore looked
for the post on Tops-20 backup tapes from CMU-20C.&nbsp; But by all accounts,
Jeff Baird should get most of the credit for doing the hard work of locating and retrieving the
data.&nbsp; He kept asking for more tapes, reading those that could still be
read, narrowing the date range, and sticking with it until the post was found.&nbsp; Thanks all for your efforts to restore this part of computing
history, and especially, thanks Jeff!</p>
