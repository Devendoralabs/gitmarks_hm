	<p>Whenever I go to Amsterdam, every once in a while I meet up with <a href="http://www.bomega.com/">Boris</a>. Now our meetings are always inspiring <i>(I guess for the both of us &#94;&#95;&#94;)</i>, full of ideas, about stuff we can do and a couple of months ago Boris came up with the following (he also <a href="http://www.bomega.com/2006/07/31/who-will-build-me-a-wi-fi-canalizer/">blogged about this</a>) </p>

	<p><i>&#8220;At this moment I can see 8 different signals. Some are closed networks but most are open and available. I can only connect to one at a time so I tend to just pick the one with the best signal. But what if I could connect to all the networks at the same time and combine their bandwith?</p>

	<p>Yeah, that is what I need!</p>

	<p>A big, fat access point with a large antenna and a bunch of Wi-Fi cards that automatically connect to the strongest signals it can pick up. Then it would combine all these signals into one FreeLoading Broadband Canal for me to use.&#8221;</i></p>

	<p>So, in the end, I guess I was the one up for the challenge and now, two days ahead of <a href="http://2007.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web Conference</a> it&#8217;s time to show the world what we&#8217;ve got!</p>

	<p>We call it:</p>

	<p><h2> the Slurpr</h2><br />
<a href="http://geektechnique.org/images/1453.jpg"><img src="http://geektechnique.org/images/1453t.jpg"></a><br />
<small>click to enlarge</small></p>

	<p><i>(the box already got its own <a href="http://Slurpr.com/">domain name</a> too!)</i></p>

	<p>What is it?</p>

	<p>Well, I (re)searched a whole lot of available hardware before I decided this is what this magic box should be:</p>

	<p><a href="http://geektechnique.org/images/1452.jpg"><img src="http://geektechnique.org/images/1452t.jpg"></a><br />
<small>click to enlarge</small></p>

	<p><i>It&#8217;s a nice black box of course, but what&#8217;s inside?</i></p>

	<p>The inside consists of a <a href="http://www.routerboard.com/rb500.html">Routerboard 532A motherboard</a> with 564 daughterboard. </p>

	<p>That on it&#8217;s own gives the following specs:</p>

	<p><b>CPU</b> <span class="caps">MIPS</span> 32 4Kc based 266MHz (<span class="caps">BIOS</span> adjustable from 200 to 400MHz) embedded processor<br />
<b>Memory</b> 64MB <span class="caps">DDR</span> onboard memory chip<br />
<b>Root loader</b> 	RouterBOOT, 1Mbit Flash chip<br />
<b>Data storage</b> 	128MB onboard <span class="caps">NAND</span> memory chip<br />
<b>CompactFlash type I/II slot</b> (also supports IBM/Hitachi Microdrive)<br />
<b>Ethernet ports</b> One <span class="caps">IDT</span> Korina 10/100 Mbit/s Fast Ethernet port supporting Auto-MDI/X, eight <span class="caps">VIA</span> VT6105 10/100 Mbit/s Fast Ethernet ports supporting Auto-MDI/X<br />
<b>MiniPCI slot</b> Six MiniPCI Type IIIA/<span class="caps">IIIB</span> slots<br />
<b>Serial ports</b> One DB9 RS232C asynchronous serial port</p>

	<p>Now that is already a nice piece of equipment, but doesn&#8217;t bring us any nearer to a solution of Boris&#8217; problem here, so I added six mini-<span class="caps">PCI</span> cards <i>(and a <a href="http://geektechnique.org/projectlab/767/put-flash-memory-into-almost-any-ipod">quite famous</a> 4GB Compact Flash card &#94;&#95;&#94;)</i>, three of which are visible in this picture:</p>

	<p><a href="http://geektechnique.org/images/1455.jpg"><img src="http://geektechnique.org/images/1455t.jpg"></a><br />
<small>click to enlarge</small></p>

	<p>The cards I ended up using are Senao/Engenius SL(NL/EL?) <a href="http://www.engeniustech.com/datacom/products/details.aspx?id=162">5354MP</a> cards with <a href="http://www.atheros.com/">Atheros</a> AR5213 chipset, for which drivers exist by the means of the <a href="http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility/Senao#a5354MPARIES24G">MadWifi project</a>. </p>

	<p><i><b>So, a small box, a <span class="caps">MIPS-CPU</span>, six wireless network interfaces, now what?</b></i></p>

	<p>Well, the idea is to bundle all the traffic from these six wireless networkinterfaces (and maybe a wired interface too) into one big connection which, if you keep the wireless interfaces down to five, otherwise you need to hook up to it by wire, could be retransmitted into one powerfull new connection! &#42;&#94;&#95;&#94;&#42;</p>

	<p><a href="http://geektechnique.org/images/1450.jpg"><img src="http://geektechnique.org/images/1450t.jpg"></a><br />
<small>click to enlarge</small></p>

	<p>The box at this moment happily boots <a href="http://www.debian.com/">Debian</a> and the bonding of all the network traffic is done in a load-balancing way, but the other way around. Instead of balancing the load of one connection over multiple servers, we balance multiple connections into one device.</p>

	<p>Now of course, even though I need some more time to finetune this setup, this is Amsterdam and this is Boris&#8217; specific solution for his problem. In Amsterdam, believe it or not, you can find a lot of unencrypted networks but even making use of unencrypted networks <strong>which are not your own</strong> is quite controversial, let alone, if we would add features which would enable the use of lightly encrypted networks(<span class="caps">WEP</span> 64/128 bit). There&#8217;s lots and lots of material out there and even though it could take the machine a while, technically this machine is able to crack lightly encrypted networks. But the question arises, will we do that and can we (from a legal point of view) do that?</p>

	<p>So, to answer that, we&#8217;re gonna ask you!</p>

	<p>Which features, according to you, should the Slurpr have?</p>

	<p><poll><form class="xpoll"><form action="/projectlab/781/slurpr-the-mother-of-all-wardrive-boxes" method="post" name="xpoll" class="xpoll" >Which features should the Slurpr have?<br /><input name="option" type="radio" value="15" checked="checked" />Put everything in it that's technologically feasible, make this box the meanest WEP-cracking wireless-bundling box ever!<br /><input name="option" type="radio" value="16" />I don't care what you make, just get me one! (you can pre-order below)<br /><input name="option" type="radio" value="17" />Bundling of network traffic is fine, but only connect to open/unencrpyted networks.<br /><input name="option" type="radio" value="18" />Bundling of network traffic is fine, but do not connect to any private network.<br /><input name="option" type="radio" value="19" />Forget it, I'll build my own, thank you very much.<br /><input name="pap_xpoll_submit" type="submit" value="vote" /><br /><a href="/projectlab/781/slurpr-the-mother-of-all-wardrive-boxes?results=6">View Results</a><input name="poll" type="hidden" value="6" /></form></form></poll><br />
<br />
</p>

	<p>Somehow, Boris and I both think we could be up for some legal consequences if we would market/sell this box in a way we both would like, so to add to the earlier question, </p>

	<p>How about the legal consequences of the Slurpr?</p>

	<p><poll><form class="xpoll"><form action="/projectlab/781/slurpr-the-mother-of-all-wardrive-boxes" method="post" name="xpoll" class="xpoll" >How about the legal consequences of the Slurpr?<br /><input name="option" type="radio" value="13" checked="checked" />I would be willing to sign a waiver, especially if that enables all kinds of features.<br /><input name="option" type="radio" value="14" />You guys sort the consequences out, I'm not signing anything!<br /><input name="pap_xpoll_submit" type="submit" value="vote" /><br /><a href="/projectlab/781/slurpr-the-mother-of-all-wardrive-boxes?results=5">View Results</a><input name="poll" type="hidden" value="5" /></form></form></poll><br />
<br />
</p>

	<p>But, even though we&#8217;re very curious about what you think of our Slurpr, no matter what&#8230; we&#8217;re gonna sell it anyway! </p>

	<p><b>The box will cost 999 euro</b>, ex taxes and ex shipping. Now that may seem very steep, but click around the web, configure it with these specs and on the material alone you&#8217;ll come very close.</p>

	<p>This box is being sold pre-assembled, pre-configured (remember you&#8217;ve got a vote in that!) and ready to slurp!</p>

	<p>So, if you would like to have this controversial box as one of the first around, <strike>make sure you pre-order your Slurpr today! Click the add to cart below and your pre-ordering through PayPal starts.</strike></p>

	<p>Next to the pre-assembled boxes, everyone can build their own of course. Maybe with a couple of wireless interfaces less than this one, that doesn&#8217;t matter. &#94;&#95;&#126; We can host the images which can be flashed directly to the Compact Flash cards. If people are willing to contribute to this project, we&#8217;d like to hear about it of course!</p>

	<p>Please call it a &#8216;wifi-stealing&#8217; or &#8216;wifi-leeching&#8217; box, this has nothing to do with wardriving (the act of locating wireless networks)</p>

	<p>It&#8217;d be great if you could host the full design specs of these so that we could build our own! </p>

	<p>Also: doesn&#8217;t the Aetheros chipset have two physical APs anyway? Would you be able to provide a slimmed-down version of the firmware to run on regular aetheros boxen like &#8211; say &#8211; the fonera of which many people have several lying around.</p>

	<p>Given that there may be more access points around that even the Slurpr can simultaneously connect to, does it feature any sort of slection? For instance: check its intenet bitrate through each connection and then picking the best out of those.</p>

	<p>This is an amazing project, and I hope that the instructions and boxen that you produce help many people.</p>

	<p>Great!! Only i am afraid that only students would wan&#8217;t to boorow there naboirs wifinetwork. but the problem is that students dont have the budget for a gadget like this. But it looks fantastic.. if only the price could get as low as 200$ i would definately buy one.</p>

	<p>Call it Lord of the Networks: one to rule them all!</p>

	<p>Nice Idea, but not practical. I&#8217;m not gonna carry this gadget with me (how about powerconsumption), rather have a card for inside my laptop. Don&#8217;t need it at home (<span class="caps">DSL</span>), or at workplace (fiber), so why shoul I ude it?</p>

<br />
	<p>Not sure some people are getting the point about this bad boy.  This uses multiple connections to give you a faster than normal connection.  Hook this up in conjunction with your <span class="caps">DSL</span> and get an even faster connection.</p>

	<p>My question is, How well might it work on US networks?  Are there going to be any tie ups there?  I&#8217;m sure US lawmakers would freak over something like this.  </p>

	<p>I would love to see more detailed specs to attempt even a smaller scale home-made version.  Like someone above said, perhaps it could be called a &#8216;student version&#8217;</p>

	<p>I just priced all the parts on this device at 500USD give or take.  Without any bulk rebate.</p>

	<p>Put an antenna combiner in the enclosure and put it all on one antenna. Having 6 antennas on the box is useless and might degrade the performance when transmitting, especially when using the same frequency for multiple emitters.</p>

	<p>Nice hoax.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not like combining 6 connections of 1 Mbit leaves you with one fat connection of 6 Mbit, it just doesn&#8217;t work that way. People who think that need to get their heads around how routing works&#8230;</p>

	<p>i think you can legaly make this box. let say i have my own network and want to cover a large distance. i could send 5 times over 1 mb bundle them to 1 5 mb network. or pigytail two of them together sending 6 time and recieving 6 times. <br />
or large bandwith:<br />
100 mb &#8211; Sl &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - Sl&#8212;100 mb</p>

	<p>all are legal!!</p>

	<p>This looks pretty sweet.  I would like to suggest an option between &#8220;connect only to open nets&#8221; and &#8220;connect to anything you can crack&#8221;... &#8220;connect to open nets, plus anything i have the key for&#8221;... that way if i have my own network i can use it additionally.  For you h4&#215;0rs, you could crack externally and load into the device.</p>

	<p>And for the haters&#8230;  &#8220;stealing&#8221; is quite a strong word.  Check out the protocols&#8230; If you don&#8217;t crack the <span class="caps">WEP</span>, here&#8217;s how it goes&#8230;  You look around (on an unlicensed spectrum I might add) and see the AP advertising a network.  You ask the AP for association, it says &#8220;sure&#8221;.  You ask the AP for an address, it says &#8220;sure, and here are some nameservers and default routes&#8221;.  Sounds like an invitation and permission to me.</p>

	<p>Oh, and to not be rude, the Slurpr should offer an option to throttle each individual connection to a user-specified limit.  That way you don&#8217;t overstay the aforementioned welcome :))</p>

	<p>very nice gadget you`re building :) i&#8217;m still wondering how you make 1 connection of the 5-6 the box conencts to.</p>

	<p>As far as i know if you download something from the net you will only get the speed of the connection the box used to send your request an leave the rest unused.. thus making it kinda useless for downloading large files using 1 http/ftp stream.. this can be overcomed by using download managers that use several http streams but not many users do :) or for torrent files</p>

	<p>If you found a way to send requests in a way that the incoming packets are fragmented by the server that send the reply then received through each connection and repacked by the box please show us how :).<br />
if you need more explications about what i meen please contact me :)</p>

	<p>Too bad this is a huge scam. There&#8217;s no way to bond the connection in the manor the guy is talking about. Sorry, it just doesn&#8217;t work that way.</p>

	<p>I can think of ways to do it, but they all involve having your own server to run the traffic through and the resulting connection would be flakier than trying to use a single connection.</p>

	<p>By having the antennas too close, you will loose efficiency, because each one will have near-field effects. I guess this is worth testing. Have each one working individually and all in tandem. I bet there&#8217;s a difference ;)</p>

	<p>This board isn&#8217;t capable of passing probably more than 30Mbps &#8211; 40Mbps at the extreme, the 400Mhz Mips 4k processor tends to stall out when processing much more than this. Also any advanced queuing they would have done in the system as well as <span class="caps">EQMPG</span> Rules (Equal Cost Multipathing Gateway Rules) would cause even more overhead so the realistic bandwidth drops down more like 24Mbps. The board could achieve more with the Nstreme2 or Nstreme protocols enabled, but since these are proprietary they would be unable to communicate with any standard 802.x signaling.</p>

	<p>In fact you can find the basics for this script setup at http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/ECMP_Failover_Script</p>

	<p>I configure and consult on this gear every day as technician at http://wisp-rotuer.com, an equipment provider for WISP&#8217;s (Wireless Internet Service Providers.) If you want a similar setup for less cash give me a call. It would just cost you the hardware and the $100.00/hr consulting fee. It would take less than an hour probably, maybe two at the outside. Bottom line looks somewhere around $600.00 to $700.00.</p>

	<p>I think you my want to do some research into this little box before anyone drops $1,300 on it. I know what hardware they are using and it&#8217;s nothing more than what we do every day here at work. They are using the following gear to accomplish this trick: All Mikrotik Gear (http://www.mikrotik.com) &#38; Routerboard gear (A Mikrotik Company).</p>

	<p>Part List:<br />
RB532-4 Single Board Mips 4k Computer: x 1 &#8211; Includes Mikrotik Lvl 4 License</p>

	<p>RB-564 Daughter Card: x 1 &#8211; Adds 6 Ether Net Ports and 4 Mini <span class="caps">PCI</span> ports as an expansion card for RB532-4</p>

	<p>I would use: <br />
CM9 MiniPCI 802.11a/b/g combo cards (Just a Guess) x 6</p>

	<p>RB5-Indoor-Large Enclosure: x 1<br />
A bent Aluminum powder coated case with ground, designed to house the RB532-4 and Rb564 Daughter board snuggly.</p>

	<p>IN24-5 Rubber Duck Antennas: x6</p>

	<p>A Power Supply My Guess 48v or 56v: As the mini pci cards will suck up some juice. The board will distribute up to 6watts I believe between the gear in the Revision 5 Board.</p>

	<p>Good luck trying to get some signal from one antenna out of the noise generated by the other five. This won&#8217;t work at all.<br />
Also, but I could be wrong here, please correct, I recall reading that current Atheros Linux drivers (madwifi?) don&#8217;t allow more than one card per system.</p>

	<p>0.8 to 1.2W in operation with <span class="caps">USB</span> and Ethernet turned on &#8211; </p>

	<p>1 to 3W for a hard disk &#8211; <br />
5 to 15W for a graphic card</p>

	<p>That gives something around 20W, so it is then possible (and recommended) to use a Pico ATX</p>

	<p><span class="caps">PSU</span> (60-80W or 120W) such as this one :&#8221; </p>

	<p>&#8220;<br />

	<p>while this OP is a windup, the basic idea has been around a long time and today you might look to use 11n or even the WiMax chips once that becomes cheap enough.</p>

	<p>why assume stealing though, its far more interesting and better to just collect up your local mates Broadband modems and make yourself a small community wireless <span class="caps">LAN</span> and put one of these standard Efiks or whatever to good combined use for all your groups Bonding benefits . YES?.</p>

	<p>you can always keep the wireless open and lock the access to the netword down to those that are footing the bill for the kit, and perhaps let a small amount through to encurage new users to join in and work with the growing wireless community group. </p>

	<p>if it becomes massive, who knows, it could become better than the comercial outfits , and you can sign contracts for everyones benefits, the commercial <span class="caps">WISP</span> companys put the cost reduced kit out there as an all in one and profit from that, and your community<br />
grows to 10GigE kit <span class="caps">LOL</span>.</p>

	<p>Interesting device, and a lot more interesting if you could make it into something which would double or triple the bandwidth of people´s own networks (e.g. having 3 wireless routers and a PC-notebook-card with 3 receivers build into it).<br />

	<p>has any one even checked the logististics of mashing multiple connections into 1 device? using 802.11g which is norm &#8211; there are 3 overlapping channels for AP&#8217;s &#8211; so if 3 neighbours/connections are using 802.11g-the default channels(6 or 1) means only 2 channels can be multiplexed&#8230;802.11a has 12 overlapping channels &#8211; but same default channels issues occur.great idea- but implausible unless you have 6 802.11a connections avail all on different channels.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that simple. This won&#8217;t work due to cochannel and adjacent channel interference issues. Unless the access points you are trying to access are on far separated channels you will have no gain at all.</p>

	<p>This is what our <span class="caps">PERM</span> project is doing (http://swing.cs.uiuc.edu/projects/perm/) except we implemented the multihoming on the client instead of the router because it was easier to add interfaces.  There are several issues that will limit your performance here.  First of all there are only 3 orthogonal channels in 802.11b/g which means you are going to get a lot of self interference reducing your transmission rate.  Secondly, you cannot do per packet load balancing unless you use a different transport protocol (<span class="caps">SCTP</span>, pTCP, <span class="caps">RMTP</span>, etc) or tunnel all your traffic to a middle box somewhere behind all of the different ISPs.  That means you have to do flow scheduling which is inherently less efficient than packet scheduling.</p>

	<p>Our <span class="caps">PERM</span> software does flow scheduling in Linux (and also beta in Windows).  It also includes incentive management and some basic privacy constraints for OpenWRT routers.  The current release is still a little buggy but I hope to get another (final) release out this summer.  It would be interesting to see how easily it can be moved onto your box.</p>

	<p>Well, if the box cracks <span class="caps">WEP</span> automatically (as I understand), then setting the box up to automatically configure the broadcasting channel of the modem probably wouldn&#8217;t be a step to far.</p>

	<p>All it would need to do is direct communications with 192.168.0.1, because most people don&#8217;t change these things, and enter the default password for the modem that is being accessed, which is normally admin or the like.</p>

	<p>What about making something that can take guaranteed connections like a phone connection and a cable connection and fuse those bandwidths?

	<p>It is unlikely that 6 wireless connections could work in such slose proximity to each other. They&#8217;d step on each other when they transmit as other folks have pointed out. You might be able to do 2 on BG if you&#8217;re using 1 and 11 &#8212; might. A would be better, but there is still a high chance of stepping on the other connections. As for link aggregation, you can load balance but not bond the channels. Some programs freak under this setup, though a lot fewer than in the past.</p>

	<p>And for all the people that say it&#8217;s stealnig&#8230; Stealing implies theft of property or money. Leeching bandwidth is neither as it is not property, and most connections are unlimited usage. I&#8217;m sure there are people that would disagree. But, if you&#8217;re dumb enough to not encrypt, or <span class="caps">MAC</span> lock, your AP &#8230;. not my problem. Now if you have taken the time to setup up anything &#8230; even 64-bit <span class="caps">WEP</span>, that is hacking a network and I agree that is wrong.</p>

	<p>ignoring the fact the OP as outlined want work, of course theres another option  to help mitigate the problem of interference.</p>

	<p>When mounting antennas for different radios as you are doing here, interference becomes a major factor. </p>

	<p>One method of reducing radio interference is by adjusting the polarity of the signals to be 90 degrees apart. </p>

	<p>That is, set up one antenna in a vertical polarization, with the other using a horizontal polarization.</p>

 The antenna documentation will denote polarization.

	<p>not perfect i know, but still something to consider in the real projects&#8230;.</p>

&#8220;The sky’s the limit: new wireless connection record  <br />
Posted by: Adam Clare | Community: Access  </p>

	<p>This is a technology that works, a proven technology, and what it needs is a bit more promotion,” said Ermanno Pietrosemoli just days after reaching a new wireless connection record of 382 kilometres. The president of Venezuelan <span class="caps">APC</span> member EsLaRed spoke with APCNews by conference call about this low-cost solution that is impacting the world’s rural communities. &#8220; </p>

	<p>imagine that distance for wardriving ;)</p>

	<p>back to this interferance, one last thought:<br />
why are the current 3rd party filer/cokes that are tuned to each wireless channel so expensive hese days, its about time the end users market got the price down so we can start filering on the channel of your choice and exclude the others so stopping interference cold&#8230;..</p>

	<p>&#8220;Could people actually stop being [b]so damn nerdy[/b], and just tell us “ normal people “ whether that is possible&#8221;....</p>

	<p>you do realise your posting that question at &#8216;geektechnique.org dont you ?.</p>

	<p>possible with some re-engineering and inclusion of the outlined options, <span class="caps">YES</span>. </p>

	<p>going out buying the kit off the shelf and reading a simple Dummies guide instruction manual to point and shoot your arials, probably not yet&#8230;..</p>

	<p>still, if people are seriously trying to make it happen.</p>

	<p>in time, and a massive fall of filtering/chokeing 11b/g/n and WiMax kit to help the interference etc ,plus off the shelf cheap consumer polarized/spiral arials to go with it , sure.</p>

	<p>its all D.I.Y right now, and asking questions and getting the answers publicly is a good thing if your a so called &#8216;nerdy&#8217; type, if you dont want to try and understand the tech, why come and read this stuff?, go play your Wee and be happy, it will arive soon enough for you to buy if the efforts put in and you have the cash.</p>

	<p>and using the free the <span class="caps">MIT</span> Roofnet wireless <span class="caps">MESH</span> codebase.</p>

	<p>http://www.dailywireless.org/2007/06/04/meraki-solar-kit/</p>

	<p>Meraki Solar Kit<br />
Merakie, the <span class="caps">MIT</span> Roofnet spinoff, today announced the new Meraki Outdoor repeater and a Solar accessory kit, that can cover entire neighborhoods with Wi-Fi inexpensively. </p>

	<p>Meraki Outdoor ($99), uses mesh networking and can send a signal up to 700 feet. </p>

	<p>Paired with Meraki’s existing indoor Mini ($49) , the Outdoor repeater can be installed on a wall or a pole outside the house. It can provide access for dozens of households sharing one high speed connection, lowering the cost per household as low as $1 to $2 a month.</p>

	<p>The Meraki indoor/outdoor repeater supports high gain and directional antennas and works with other Meraki repeaters to create robust networks. </p>

	<p>Features include: </p>

	<p>Unique industrial design (weatherproof plastics, easy to mount) <br />
Dual <span class="caps">SSID</span> supports public and private networks on the same connection <br />
Long-range support (400-700 ft; 6-18 miles with antenna) <br />
2 &#215; 100Mbit Ethernet ports <br />
Low-cost: $99 <br />
The Meraki Solar accessory kit will allow the repeater to broadcast a signal without being connected to any electrical source. </p>

	<p>Once connected, Meraki Solar’s power usage can be distributed throughout the day and managed by the Meraki Dashboard service ensuring the repeater is powered during peak usage times. </p>

	<p>The solar kit includes a solar panel, battery pack and an outdoor Ethernet cable. Pricing will be set later this summer. </p>

	<p>The Meraki Dashboard is a web-hosted management tool designed to make monitoring, configuring, and monetizing a Meraki Network easy. It’s included with all Meraki products. </p>

	<p>“The Meraki Solar and Meraki Outdoor will play an important role in our efforts to bring the next billion people online in the coming years,” said Sanjit Biswas, <span class="caps">CEO</span> and a co-founder of Meraki.</p>

	<p>I would buy one if this device could steal operator&#8217;s network, not my neighbour&#8217;s one. After all, probably my neighbour is, more or less, as rich as me. Have you thought about donating some of your bandwith to your neighbour? Perhaps he/she needs it more than you do&#8230;<br />

	<p>Interesting read, though expensive setup. I&#8217;m more interested in the software side of the Slurpr. I&#8217;d really like to see how they automated connection aggregation and how well it works. I did manage to aggregate 3 connections with Mikrotik, but it&#8217;s cumbersome to do it manually, and it was connection based, bah&#8230;</p>

	<p>Interesting box made out of off the shelf components. I just checked this out and reckon it&#8217;ll cost about £560 but using Engenius 400mW radios instead. </p>

	<p>The queries I have about this are</p>

	<p>1. Near field interference from the close proximity of the antennas. Higher gain, more problems&#8230;<br />
It would be possible to remote the antennas physically away from each other or use directional to limit this (spiral too, as pointed out) but you&#8217;d have to consider the cable and connector loss. Not too much of a problem if you are running 26dBm 2.4GHz radios with a 90deg 16dBi panel (~15 Watts <span class="caps">EIRP</span>)</p>

	<p>2. Why six radios when there are only three non-overlapping channels. 6 associations to 6 separate SSID&#8217;s will only result in interference and a drop in throughput. (Obviously different at 5GHz, but how many prople have 802.11a AP&#8217;s?)</p>

	<p>I would love to see some stats on how it performs in 2.4GHz radio environment as well as how the link aggregation works out.</p>

	<p>The only obvious real purpose for these quantities of radios would be to improve cracking times on encrypted networks (see Janus project). Increase the amount of traffic using arp injection and you&#8217;ll compromise faster. (see  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/15/wep_crack_interview/)</p>

	<p>Shall look forward to seeing how this develops and some results&#8230;<br />
Cheers</p>

	<p>It would be brilliant to use this system just like you do with torrents. Develop a tool which tracks the up and download from your connection. At home u can have a quicker internet connection. And if u can get this setup working from a laptop with a small adapter u can go online from wherever people are sharing their connection.</p>

	<p>I think that this box looks absolutely wonderful and if I could afford it (and it were more messenger bag friendly, I would get it. As for all of you talking about the legalities of wifi-cracking&#8230; everyone who would get this device is most likely aware of the legalities involved. </p>

	<p>As for my thoughts on the legalities:<br />
I think that it&#8217;s not entirely fair to compare the usage of an unsecured network to that of an unsecured house. There are obvious differences between the two ethically. If you connect to the network and are snooping around on their computers for credit card numbers that may be in a plain txt file that they saved (while they may deserve it if they do something stupid like that, yes, ive seen it happen) it is wrong. In the case of wifi, you arent doing any harm to them, you arent breaking and entering. Not securing your wireless network could be a way for people to say that they dont mind if you use it.</p>

	<p>Also, in the sense of picking a lock and entering a house, that is probably a rather decent way of measuring. I do agree that cracking an encrypted network is wrong, however, that doesn&#8217;t neccesarily mean that people wont do it even though they know that it&#8217;s wrong. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;d like to see more wired connections for lan parties.  As it is possible for friends to bring their cable modems to one house , and pull up there legitimate payed for IP&#8217;s by simply plugging them all in to a coax splitter. So far I&#8217;ve found this to work seemingly statewide , obviously they all have to be from the same provider.  But the idea of combining all our cable modems , and the wifi of some of the neighbors whom are down for the cause makes my palms sweaty and hairy!!</p>

	<p>Why just make it a leach? why not make it connect and give bandwidth, and pass packets as well? make a true mesh network topology that sidesteps isps all together.</p>

	<p>Well, the device wouldn&#8217;t be illegal to have, although there are many illegal purposes for it in the states, but from an engineering point of view, you want to have better hardware and spread out the atenna&#8217;s some.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve never been able to use more than 1 gateway at a time.  Never been able to  &#8220;combine&#8221; multiple internet connections for more bandwidth.  <br />
How are they gonna do that?</p>

	<p>As the internet bandwidth of the leeched AP&#8217;s will not surpass 2-22Mb in amsterdam, with 1 AP you could theoretically leech 2 AP&#8217;s together if you do your programming right. No need to install 6 wifi units I think unless you are doing a simple software hack. But how do you bind all those different IP addresss into 1 big pipe? You won&#8217;t. At most you do some smart load balancing on tcp connection level. This seems like a theoretical product that will not function in real life.</p>

	<p>First, for those routes to work, each wireless conncetion should have diferent gateways.. example</p>

	<p>WLAN1 192&#8230;1.1<br />
WLAN2 192&#8230;2.1<br />
WLAN3 192&#8230;3.1</p>

	<p>If no, mikrotik doesnt load balance</p>

	<p><span class="caps">DD-WRT</span> has an script wich is scanning for open wifi, if it find, it join, if it lost signal, will take another, it it can join but no inet connection, will take another<br />
Its good for example when you are traveling :P</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll test someday</p>

	<p>Once again, there&#8217;s always that guy with the &#8220;walk into someone&#8217;s house and take their TV because it was unlocked&#8221; analogy, and once again I will cry INAPT!!!!! INAPT!!!!! INAPT!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

	<p>for that to work, bandwidth would have to be sold by usage, and depletable (and I&#8217;m being realistic..not talking being a worldwide usenet warez supplier). It all depends on the details of the abuse..not saying it&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m just saying.. Find a better bloody analogy already, and then resume snivelling.</p>

	<p>You should add a filter capable of blocking any external pings or foreign frequencies blocking their access to the box or attempts to locate the slurpr thus turning it into a stealth wifi slurpr :)</p>

	<p>Good luck trying to get some signal from one antenna out of the noise generated by the other five. This won’t work at all.<br />
Also, but I could be wrong here, please correct, I recall reading that current Atheros Linux drivers (madwifi?) don’t allow more than one card per system.</p>

	<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it make more sense to allow this device to connect to free &#38; open wifi&#8217;s ,and allow the buyer to mod the box to support wep/<span class="caps">WPA</span> cracking?<br />
Besides WEP/<span class="caps">WPA</span> cracking can be done from the host pc,not needed in the router.</p>

	<p>You mentioned MadWiFi; if I understood correctly, you are using a <span class="caps">MIPS</span> motherboard and I think you are going to get into trouble installing the <span class="caps">HAL</span> for MadWiFi on a <span class="caps">MIPS</span> architecture.

	<p>I have tried something similar recently: I have a Arch Linux machine as my LAN&#8217;s gateway to the Internet and thought to myself, it had 3 free <span class="caps">PCI</span> slots why not put some WiFi cards in there and beef up my connection. I managed to get them all in and get onto 3 WiFi networks with them but I am at my limit of knowledge. I can&#8217;t figure out how to &#8220;load balance&#8221; over the 3 WiFi networks. On a 2 day Google hunt for the answer is how I found this page. I would actually buy one of these if one is for sale, if not I would love to know more about it so maybe I could built one.</p>

	<p>I just see one major problem with it. The thing i see is trying to set it up as like a repeater. what would happen if you hooked it up to send all that massive bandwidth to a wireless router. then it decides that the connection from the router that it is hardwired up to is better than one of the signals that it is already getting. then whatever data is sent through that wireless channel would be stuck in an infinite loop</p>
