        <h2>Need to index the blogosphere?</h2>
        <p>Spinn3r is a web service for indexing the blogosphere. We provide raw
        access to every blog post being published - in real time. We provide the
        data, and you can focus on building your application, mashup, or search
        engine.  We find the weblogs and RSS, index their content, fetch the
        links, index their comments, etc.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <p>
            Developers within your company call our API every few seconds for
            the freshest news content - syndicated to you in real time.  With
            our Open Source reference client, you can be up and running in less
            than an hour.  All with <a href="/savings" style="color:white">massive costs
            savings</a>.  Spinn3r can save you up to $45k per month compared to
            running your own crawler!
        </p>

<h3>Maximum Throughput</h3>

<p>Forty million (40M) blogs and counting, ten thousand (10K) Mainstream News
sources and more than 30M Social Media sources; expect a torrent of content from
Spinn3r - more than one million (1M) posts per hour.  Not only do we index every
A-list blog out there, we also watch every mainstream news source and all the
major Social Media platforms (both <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>
and <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>)</p>
    
<h3>High Availability Architecture</h3>

<p>Spinn3r is built on a fault tolerant infrastructure and is monitored 24/7 to
ensure 99.9% availability.  Every component in our system has three redundant
copies with standby hardware already online in case of failure.</p>

<p>We're also hosted in a <a href="http://softlayer.com" target="_new">state of the art data
center</a> with redundant power and three standby generators.</p>

<h3>Advanced Metadata</h3>

<p>We can provide you with the top 10k or 10M weblogs, and can filter by language 
and by posts for a specific site - from a specific author. Tags, language, spam 
probability, rank, raw inbound link count, etag, HTTP status - all are included 
within our API.</p>

<p>We go above and beyond user specified metadata.  Often some of the metadata
can be incorrect. Language is a good example.  We use a mathematical language
modeling technique which has been in production for more than two years now.
With only 200 bytes of text, we can analyze the language of a post with 98%
accuracy.
</p>

<h3>Indexed in Real Time</h3>

<p>Spinn3r is updated in real time.  When we receive a ping from any of the
major ping providers we go off and collect their content, index it, and make it
available via our API.</p>

<p>We don't stop there.  We have a hybrid indexing technology that 
enables us to launch our crawlers every thirty minutes against sites that 
don't provide pings.</p>

<p>When we see the content, so do you.  We push the content to your application as 
soon as we see it so you are always current.</p>

<h3>Full Crawler</h3>

<p>Spinn3r goes above and beyond indexing just raw RSS - we index the full HTML
of a post.  After that, we extract the body of the post, excluding sidebar and
chrome, and provide this content under a <a href="/content-extract">content
extract API</a>.</p>
  
<h3>Open Source and Standards Based</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spinn3r-client">Spinn3r reference
client</a> is fully Open Source and standards based.</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://spinn3r-client.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/index.html">Java
API</a> is fully documented and can be integrated directly with your application
as a standalone daemon indexing new content and saving it to disk.  This allows
for easy integration with Perl, Python, Javascript, or any language that has an
XML parser.</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>What are you waiting for?  You can be using Spinn3r in a few minutes.
Request an evaluation and we'll give you a full one week trial period to play
with Spinn3r.  We also have a thirty day money back refund program. If, for
whatever reason, Spinn3r doesn't work out for you, we'll give you a full refund
on your first month of service.</p>

<p>
So <a href="/contact">request an evaluation today</a> and we'll have you up and
running in no time!

<h3><a href="http://blog.spinn3r.com/2009/06/spinn3r-31---now-with-twitter-support-and-social-media-ranking.html">Spinn3r 3.1 was just released with both Twitter firehose support and Social
Media Rank</a></h3>

<p>    
Spinn3r listens to a new Twitter firehose API which is a sample of the full Twitter feed.
</p>    

<p> All Twitter content is classified with a new MICROBLOG publisher type which
we will be using for Twitter, Identi.ca, Jaiku, and other Microblog systems.
</p>    

<p> Further, it is language classified (using an algorithm we have developed)
and includes all metadata from Twitter including publication time, author name,
handle, etc.

<b>Social Media Rank:</b>
</p>

    <p>
        Spinn3r <b><a href="/rank/">Social Media Rank</a></b> is a new feature we're making
        available to both our customers and the Internet community.
    </p>

    <p>
        We rank social media by looking at friendship and link relationships
        within the social graph.
    </p>

    <p>
        We limit our published rankings to the top 10k sources from each
        service.

    <table width="100%" class="rank-providers">

            <td valign="middle" align="center"><a href="/rank/friendfeed.php"><img src="/rank/friendfeed.png" width="100" /></a></td>

        </tr>

    </table>

<h3><a href="/screenshots">Full Admin Console</a></h3>
<p>
A new feature in 3.0 is our new admin console.  We expose everything about our
internal operation including crawl throughput, language breakdown, publisher
type breakdown, throughput per publisher, ping frequency, etc.  Take a look at
some of our <a href="/screenshots">screenshots</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>Spinn3r 3.0 ships with a grand unified API (our permalink API) that allows you to index the full RSS, full HTML, content extract, and all associated metadata under the same framework.</p>

<h3><a href="/content-extract">Content Extraction and <br>Chrome Removal</a></h3>

<p>One of the most exciting features of Spinn3r is the ability to remove chrome
and isolate only the specific content on a given HTML page. Many sources include only 
a summary, but not the full RSS content. For a full text search engine
this could be fatal, and you might end up missing content.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're using Spinn3r, you won't have this problem.</p>

<h3><a href="/spam-prevention">Integrated Spam Prevention</a></h3>

<p>Hate spam?  Don't worry - we've got your back!  Spinn3r ships with
integrated spam prevention.</p>

<h3><a href="/statistics">Public Statistics</a></h3>

<p>Want to take a peek at some of our internal statistics?  We're sharing a lot
of our internal stats with the public including language breakdown, CMS
breakdown, post frequency, etc.</p>
