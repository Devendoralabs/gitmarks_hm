        <h2>Delighting with Data</h2>
        <p class="note">This was a talk written for <a href="http://oxford.geeknights.net/2008/jun-25th/">Oxford Geek Night 7</a> on June 25th 2008, given again at <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/">Ebay UK</a> and <a href="http://www.gluelondon.com/">Glue Digital</a>, and published in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/beekr/3175095628/">Things Our Friends Have Written on the Internet 2008</a>.</p>

            <p>Hello, I'm Tom. I'm talking today about delighting with data.</p>
            <p>You're probably here because you're a geek. That's cool, so am I. And if you're anything like me, you probably like data, and lots of it. I'm sure you know loads of fantastic examples of repurposing boring data for incredibly useful stuff.</p>
            <p>But sometimes we geeks forget about all the delightful and beautiful things we can build. The things that aren't necessarily useful or purposeful, but pointless, silly and wonderful. So, I'm talking about building beautiful things out of (sometimes) boring data sources. I'll be talking less about design and visualisation, and more about projects and 'things'.</p>

            <p>The first thing I want to talk about is making things talk.</p>
          </div>

            <p>So, this is Tower Bridge. I work near here and cycle across it twice daily. Everyone loves Tower Bridge, it's completely unique and a fantastic piece of Victorian engineering.</p>
            <p>The bridge lifts four or five times a day, but you'd be surprised how many people live or work nearby and have never seen it do so.</p>
            <p>So, one day over lunch, my colleague <a href="http://www.infovore.org">Tom Armitage</a> decided to put it on Twitter - you can see it at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/towerbridge">@towerbridge</a>.</p>
            <p>It's not magic - the secret is that there's a schedule published online, and it's pulled down nightly and parsed for the boat times. It does not work, as one blogger suggested, with a manual operator inside the bridge. It's currently got 424 followers and was splashed across a few popular blogs recently.</p>
            <p>One thing you'll notice is how it talks in the 1st person. This is really important. It projects a personality and a voice, and provides space for people to react to it and talk back to it. I've been known to twitter my annoyance at being stuck waiting for it close. I will make no comment on <a href="http://londonist.com/2008/05/tower_bridge_tw.php">some people's opinions</a> about the hidden sexuality of its constant opening and closing.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>And this is the code. It's about 40 lines or something, and was built in about 20 mins. There are hundreds of ways to improve this - It's run by a cronjob every minute, which is horribly inefficient - but that's not the point. It works, and it's running. Don't let thinking get in the way of building - build, then think.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>So, the thing with making things talk is that often the output is really easy. The hard bit is the input: getting the data and manipulating it into something usable.</p>
            <p>Sometimes that input comes from dull spreadsheet-like web pages or databases, like @towerbridge, but with the price of interesting sensors dropping pretty rapidly, it's possible to build stuff that responds to touch, squeeze, sound, conductance, location or anything you can practically think of.</p>

            <p>Quite a lot of the book is about this thing - the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Ardiuno</a>. It's an open source hardware prototyping platform, designed for rapid gluing together of inputs and outputs. It uses a language called Wiring, which is similar to Processing, and it's got a great development environment. It's about &pound;18, available from <a href="http://www.tinker.it/">Tinker.it</a>.</p>

            <p>And with it, you can build things like this. This is <a href="http://www.botanicalls.com/twitter/">kit for a plant pot that twitters</a> when it needs watering. It's made up of a condictivity sensor, an Arduino, an ethernet breakout for the Arduino, wiring and power. But let's face it, if you need to use twitter to garden, you're probably not on the path to horticultural greatness.</p>

            <p>As you can tell, I really like <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> as a delivery method. Twitter is about "what are you doing now?" - action, presence and the now. It's great for delivering timely information straight to people, and perhaps most importantly it's really easy to integrate with.</p>

            <p>Making things listen is the next step. Putting data back into objects and for them to respond. "d towerbridge up" is the ultimate vision for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/towerbridge">@towerbridge</a>.</p>

            <p>Whilst we're nowhere near the semantic web, there are an increasing number of services providing data in useful, machine readable formats.</p>
            <p>For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Museum">some Wikipedia pages contain longitudes and latitudes</a>. Geonames take regular dump of these pages, parse for co-ordinates, and then provide a <a href="http://www.geonames.org/wikipedia.html">web service allowing look up of Wikipedia entries around a specified place</a>.</p>

            <p>You may have heard of <a href="http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/">Fire Eagle</a> from Yahoo. It's a location broker service, designed to sit between the user and the web services they use. You tell it your location, it can handle requests from other services for it, to the degree of privacy that you set. It can receive your locations in lots of different manners - postcode, longlat, mobile tower id. They abstraction all the difficult stuff away, leaving the web services to just get on and consume geo data.</p>
            <p>As a developer, it's really easy to use. It uses OAuth for delegating access rights to services, which everyone seems to be moving towards nowadays.</p>
            <p>One of the reasons I like it so much it that there can only be constant improvement in the way data gets fed into it. For example, it's a bit boring having to type in post codes and the like, but there's a hack out there for the iPhone allowing it to seamlessly update your location at regularly intervals from your current mobile tower ID or wifi point.</p>

            <p>If you combine the Geonames Wikipedia data with Fire Eagle you can build something like this. This is <a href="http://wikinear.com/">wikinear.com</a>, written by <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a>. It's quite simple - it shows you Wikipedia pages near you. Awesome!</p>
            <p>Written in 200 lines of Django, he wrote up a <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2008/Mar/22/wikinear/">great blog post explaining how it works</a>. Basically, there's no database - it's just web services glue. This is the future.</p>

            <p>I liked it so much that it was inspiration for this. This is <a href="http://pubs.iamnear.net">pubs.iamnear.net</a>. It grabs pub data from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> and provides a really simple mobile interface for finding your nearest pub. It can use Fire Eagle if you choose to, but otherwise it accepts any old post code or street name. Thanks to the OSM community it's got nearly 9000 pubs in.</p>

            <p>And this is its sister site: <a href="http://megaliths.iamnear.net">megaliths.iamnear.net</a>. This is perhaps the more delightful side of discovering across space. I found a <a href="http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/googleEarth/">KML file from the Modern Antiquarian</a> which contained every stone megalith in the UK.

            <p>Eventually, it shows you a photo. It searches the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a>, returning the first photo it finds taken at the same time in a completely different place. If it find nothing, it waits and tries later. Eventually a picture pops up, but it's someone else's picture, from someone else's space.</p>

            <p>In a similar vein, this is <a href="http://www.twitter.com/abovelondon">@abovelondon</a>, which speaks the schedule when the International Space Station is visible over London and where to find it in the sky. It was written by <a href="http://blech.vox.com/library/post/moreabovelondon.html">Paul Mison for his Hackday project in 2007</a>, but it seems to be dead now.</p>

            <p>I'm afraid there are no decent pictures for this. It's called <a href="http://tech90s.walkerart.org/nj/transcript/nj_04.html">Live Wire</a> and was made by Natalie Jeremijenko in 1995 for the XEROX PARC office.</p>
            <p>Imagine a piece of string dangling from the office ceiling. Every time a piece of data flows across the network a motor the string is attached to, pulses. As data flows more frequently and the usage on the network rises, the motor fires more frequently, jumping and spinning the string more violently.</p>
            <p>A beautiful way of visualising something which is normally invisible: is someone downloading and slowing down my connection?</p>

            <p>So, this is the point where I make a conclusion, recap on the key learning points, and sign all your personal development forms.</p>
            <p>Except I won't, because there isn't really much of a thread to take away with you. I'm sure you can draw your own conclusions.</p>
            <p>I guess the only real thread is that most of these projects are really small and really simple. Less than a day for most, some less than an hour. I have difficulty with any project that I can't release in a few hours - it starts getting too unwieldy and I never finish it off. Build first, think later. And try and squeeze making some fun stuff into your day.</p>
            <p>I think that's it. Thanks for listening.</p>
