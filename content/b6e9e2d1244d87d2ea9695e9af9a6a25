<h1>Service no longer available</h1>
<p>Due to a server migration, the Firefox Extension Wizard is no longer functioning. Don't panic! The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/tools/builder">Add-on Builder</a> at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">addons.mozilla.org</a> should suit your needs, and is actively maintained, unlike the code here was.
<p>Thanks for visiting,
