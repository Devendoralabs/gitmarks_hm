    <h1 class="article">How to write a website specification</h1>
  <p>A good website is one that has been well thought out from the start. We 
      will suggest the points you might consider and show you how to write a good 
      website specification. We have included an <a href="example_website_specification.htm" title="example of a web site specification">example 
      website specification</a> that you can copy to use as the basis for the 
      specification of your own website.</p>
    <p>It can be easier to work with a website designer to develop a specification. 
      We find that the end result is improved and mid project changes are minimised 
      if we visit our clients at the start of a project and work together to produce 
      a specification. </p>
    <h2>Decide why you need a website</h2>
    <p>The most important thing in any specification is to clearly state what 
      you want the end product to do, however this bit is normally left out of 
      a website specification. We will use our website as an example:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class="bold"> 
        <p><em>&quot;We want people to find out about our web design, search engine 
          optimisation, and accessibility services by searching the web. We want 
          them contact us to discuss their website requirements&quot;</em></p>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&quot;We want people to find&quot; dictates that this site must have good 
      search engine rankings. Around 90% of the traffic to this site comes from 
      searches where our entry appears within the first 5 entries. The following 
      points could be included in a specification:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The website should be accessible to search engine spiders and be coded 
        with good on-page search engine optimisation.</li>
      <li>The navigation system should be intuitive and allow the visitor to quickly 
        navigate the site starting from any page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is more to search engine optimisation than the coding of the web 
      site itself. The number of inbound links, and the relevance and quality 
      of those links is important. A good web designer should know how to arrange 
      inbound links, although this work tends to be laborious and expensive.</p>
    <p>It's difficult to specify an exact requirement, but you could add the following 
      to the specification:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The designer should include separately a budget for link building. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>And/Or</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The designer should help set up an advertising account (such as Google 
        Adwords) to attract traffic to the website. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These statements are vague and would have to be firmed up in discussions 
      with your designer. A good designer should be able to suggest an appropriate 
      level of link building and advertising for your target market.</p>
    <p> Find out more in our <a href="search-engines.htm">search engine 
      optimisation</a> section.</p>
    <h2>Writing style</h2>
    <p>The specification should be written in definite terms. Don't write &quot;If 
      possible the 'list of widgets' page should include a search box that visitors 
      could use to search all products&quot;. Instead write &quot;The 'list of 
      widgets' page <em>will</em> include a search box that visitors can use to 
      search all products&quot;. If is isn't possible then your web designer will 
      tell you, and you can amend the specification.</p>
    <h2>Define the primary content of your site</h2>
    <p>The primary content of your site is the information that a visitor will 
      need to find the products or services they need and contact you. </p>
    <p>Write a list of your key products or services on paper. Each product range 
      should have it's own page for effective search engine ranking so you have 
      effectively written a page list. Make a note of the information you would 
      like to include on each page. For example:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span class="bold">Home page</span>: An overview of what your company 
        does and what products and services it provides.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"> Product 1: </span>Details of product range 1 including 
        prices, technical details, illustration etc</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Product 2:</span> Product range 2 etc...... </p>
      <p><span class="bold">Contact us:</span> A page with full contact details 
        and maybe a map. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>List each page on a sheet of paper and make a note of the content you would 
      like to see on each page. Think about what you want each page to do and 
      write it down. Try to group the pages into sections or categories. </p>
    <p>You will know your company and products better than any web designer so 
      you should be prepared to supply a draft for the wording for the pages in 
      Microsoft Word format. Your web designer may suggest changes in order to 
      optimise the site for search engines and ease of use for visitors.</p>
    <h2>Define your secondary content</h2>
    <p>A site with primary content alone could be a bit dry. If you only show 
      your products then your potential customers may not appreciate your expertise. 
      Think about including a few pages showing how your company has benefited 
      your clients, or convey your expertise in your field. Try to present a human 
      face to your visitors. Your site will be more effective if visitors can 
      see there is a human behind it rather than a computer.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span class="bold">Case studies:</span> Short articles describing how 
        our services have benefited clients. </p>
      <p><span class="bold">About us:</span> A page with details about our company, 
        perhaps including a short history. This page might include or link to 
        a page showing pictures of your employees and a short summary of their 
        expertise. </p>
      <p><span class="bold">Articles:</span> Articles about your specialist fields 
        which will convey your expertise to your visitors. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is a good idea to include extra pages just to attract visitors to your 
      site. We included a page about MGB restoration in a page that specialises 
      in MGB parts and sat back to watch the log files. 95 percent of people who 
      read the article also looked at the MG parts pages.</p>
    <h2>Functionality and usability</h2>
    <p>Have a look at your competitor's websites. How easy are they to use? You 
      will probably know what they offer better than most visitors so if you can't 
      find information then neither can other visitors to their site. What features 
      of their sites make them easy to use? If your competitor's sites are all 
      poor try looking at other sites on the web. </p>
    <p>Have a look at the<a href="web-design/web-page-design.htm" target="_blank"> 
      guide to web design</a> for more thoughts on web design and usability.</p>
    <p>Many directories have bars across the top of every page which allow visitors 
      to select a category or perform a search for products. Smaller sites can 
      make do with drop down menus. This site uses expanding menus. Decide what 
      you find most usable and write it in to your specification.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The site will feature drop down menus on every page. A search box will 
        appear on the home page and will give the visitor the option of an advanced 
        search.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Style and layout</h2>
    <p>If you don't have any strong preferences about the style of layout of your 
      site then it may be best to see what your designer offers. If you have any 
      preferences about the image or strong dislikes then you should include them 
      in the specification.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each page on the site should feature our company logo.</li>
      <li>The site should include our corporate colours.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Additional requirements</h2>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>In the UK the <a href="disability_discrimination_act.htm">Disability Discrimination 
      Act</a> (DDA) requires that you make a reasonable effort to ensure that 
      any service you provide is accessible to disabled people. From October 2004 
      the DDA will specifically include websites as services. You will probably 
      want to include the following line in your specification:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The site must comply with W3C WAI (World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility 
        Initiative) level A Guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are based in the USA and are funded by the government then your 
      site should meet Section 508 Guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The site must comply with US Section 508 Accessibility Guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Code validation</h3>
    <p>It makes sense that your site is written to a high standard of code so 
      that it continues to work correctly on future browsers. You could also include 
      the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All code on the site should validate to W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) 
        specifications.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Maintenance</h3>
    <p>After the website is launched it will need to be updated with new information 
      or you will find some area that you want to change. Most web designers offer 
      maintenance contracts, but you might want to be able to update your site 
      yourself using a low cost package such as Macromedia Contribute. You could 
      add the following line to your specification:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It must be possible for us to update the content of the site using a 
        low cost software package.</li>
      <li>The web designer will provide on-site training for 2 of our staff in 
        how to use this software package.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hosting</h3>
    <p>Your site will need to be uploaded to a web host and re-validated to ensure 
      no problems have arisen when putting the site on-line. Your designer should 
      be able to find a good web host and set up your E-mail.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A reliable web host will be found for the completed site, and the designer 
        will load the site onto the web and set up E-mail, FTP access, and carry 
        out any other administration necesary to set up the site.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Support</h3>
    <p>In a very complex site it is likely that the occasional small bug may get 
      through the validation process. You will need continued support from your 
      designer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any bugs or errors found on the site after launch will be rectified 
        free of charge.</li>
    </ul>
