			<h1>Levels of HTML knowledge</h1>
			<p class="preamble">Inspired by Emil Stenström&#8217;s <a href="http://friendlybit.com/css/levels-of-css-knowledge/">Levels of CSS knowledge</a>, I started thinking about the extreme difference in HTML knowledge among people working in the web industry. It spans all the way from people who know next to nothing about it to those who know it well enough to write the actual HTML specifications.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d describe a few different levels of HTML knowledge. For some people, these levels are stages that they pass while learning more and more about HTML, gradually understanding concepts such as web standards, semantics, and accessibility. Others are at a certain level because it matches their attitude towards HTML and coding in general. Many people never advance beyond the first few levels. For some that is just fine, while for others it is not.</p>

<p>This is all written in a tongue-in-cheek way and is just my personal opinion. Please don&#8217;t over-react if you don&#8217;t agree or think some of the descriptions are a bit harsh. Try laughing instead.</p>

<p>The levels then:</p>

<h2>HTML Level 0</h2>
<p>People at this level have never seen HTML except by mistake, like when accidentally opening an HTML email in text mode. These people do not work in the web industry and never will, so they have no wish or reason to move beyond Level 0. They are included in this article to provide a kind of bottom line.</p>
<p>Typical quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Age-tee-em-what?</p></blockquote>

<h2>HTML Level 1</h2>
<p>These people use the web enough to know that some kind computer programming magic is going on behind the scenes of the websites they use. When trying to publish anything on the Web, they are helpless without a WYSIWYG editor of some kind. It could be Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Frontpage, or the editor built into the CMS they have been told to use.</p>
<p>People keeping a website&#8217;s content up to date can often be found at this skill level, and some argue that there should be no need for them to move to a higher level. A lot of visually oriented designers are firmly stuck here by choice, often defending that choice by saying that &#8220;Nobody in the print world edits PostScript code by hand, so why should the web be any different?&#8221; Many web project managers unfortunately fail to progress beyond Level 1.</p>
<p>Typical quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>HTML? It&#8217;s those tags you use to make text bold or italic.</p></blockquote>

<h2>HTML Level 2</h2>
<p>This level contains people who know enough about HTML to be able to find their way around an HTML document as long as they stick to the few tags (everything is called a tag at this level) they recognise. They don&#8217;t really want to touch the HTML though.</p>
<p>Many Level 2 people are back-end programmers who prefer the safety of Visual Studio or whatever IDE they are using. They think HTML is too simple for them to bother with and that applications should be smart enough to handle it all for them. Level 2 developers seem very popular with CMS vendors.</p>
<p>Typical quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The controls I drag and drop in my IDE work fine in Internet Explorer, so why should I have to even look at the HTML?</p></blockquote>

<h2>HTML Level 3</h2>
<p>A lot of old school web developers who have been in the business since the late nineties can be found at this level. Up until the end of last century these people coded HTML by hand, so they know all about nested tables and spacer GIFs. Since then, WYSIWYG editors like GoLive and Dreamweaver have improved to the point where Level 3 people see no reason to learn more about HTML. These days most of their HTML-related work is done in their editor&#8217;s design view anyway, so they would rather spend their time learning a specific application instead of finding out more about what is going on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Typical quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah yeah, I&#8217;ve heard about those fancy new <code>ul</code> and <code>h1</code> tags, but I&#8217;m doing just fine with my trusty old <code>table</code>, <code>img</code>, and <code>br</code> tags.</p></blockquote>

<h2>HTML Level 4</h2>
<p>This level is where people start intentionally using doctypes. The first step is almost always a transitional doctype, often XHTML 1.0 Transitional. XHTML is more recent than HTML after all, so it&#8217;s got to be better, right? People at this level are also the biggest fans of XHTML 1.1, since they think a higher version number has to be better.</p>
<p>After hearing from someone that you shouldn&#8217;t use tables for layout, a lot of Level 4 people use <code>div</code> elements to recreate a table-like structure. This of course leads to tag soup being replaced by div mania, and a lot of presentational markup, classitis, and inline CSS are produced by people at this level.</p>
<p>Most web developers who have reached Level 4 are willing to keep learning, and they understand that there are advantages to the methods being promoted by web standards oriented blogs and books. But they haven&#8217;t yet grasped <em>why</em> those methods are better.</p>
<p>Typical quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>How can I create a data table with divs and spans instead of tables?</p></blockquote>

<h2>HTML Level 5</h2>
<p>Most standards aware web professionals can be found here. These people tend to think about structure and semantics first and presentation later. Strict doctypes are generally used at this level to encourage the separation of semantic and presentational markup. Whether the markup language is HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 is less important to many. In fact, some people at Level 5 are questioning the use of XHTML. Level 5 people tend to get into endless discussions about tiny markup details. They can waste hours thinking about class names or reorganising their HTML and CSS files to make their code look pretty.</p>
<p>If you have reached this level I think you&#8217;re doing extremely well. For most people there is no compelling reason to move beyond this Level 5.</p>
<p>Typical quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hmm. I wonder which type of list is the most semantic way to mark up this part of my document.</p></blockquote>

<h2>HTML Level 6</h2>
<p>These people are the thinkers of the industry. They spend a lot of time contemplating what will be useful in the future instead of right here and now. The results of much of their work will probably not be of any practical use to the average web professional for at least another five years.</p>
<p>At Level 6 you may have moved beyond actually building websites for a living. Instead you may be concentrating on writing future specifications or interpreting existing ones for browser vendors.</p>
<p>Typical quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 2 specs are too semantically limited, so I am working on a new markup language.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Finding the right level</h2>
<p>It isn&#8217;t necessary for everybody to reach HTML Level 6. I consider myself a Level 5 person, and I&#8217;m quite happy reading the specs instead of writing them so I don&#8217;t really feel like I need to reach Level 6. People whose task is to keep a website&#8217;s content up-to-date can even get by at Level 1, provided that their CMS is good enough. It all depends on your needs.</p>

<p>What does not, however, is your attitude towards HTML. Even if you don&#8217;t need or want to learn all there is about HTML, you have to acknowledge that it is the most important language on the web.</p>

<p>What level of HTML knowledge are you at, and what level are you aiming for?</p>

							<p>I feel that the quote in level 6 belongs to the level 3-4 people ;)
HTML being semantically limited makes sense, and inventing new markup languages - doesn&#8217;t (most often).
Now, does this bring me from level 5 to level 6?</p>

							<p>Maybe it&#8217;s more appropriate to say:
&#8220;These people are the philosophers of the industry&#8221; for Level 6.  It&#8217;s not as if Levels 4 and 5 don&#8217;t think, they just think on the practical level.  The level that most of us need to get to.  If we were all Level 6, I&#8217;d bet there would be a whole lot of mess in the industry.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t know many Level 0&#8217;s.  Everybody seems to be aware of HTML, even me mum.  She just thinks that it&#8217;s the sort of &#8220;highfalutin computer nonsense to be left to the nerds&#8221;, like her son.</p>

							<p>Nice one Roger.</p>

<p>Personally i have to question myself honestly, and in which case i&#8217;m at that level. I try to be at level 5, and i understand many theories of level 5, and i can build them that way. But due to time limits and customers who want eyecandy and care less about people with disabilities the working flow for me will be between level 4 and 5. Although my aim will be level 5. For level 6 i do not have the time and stamina, but luckily there are others who are.</p>

							<p>I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m at level 5.01 who thinks about level 6 stuff on occasion. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m torn on the use of semantic class names. My class names tend to be a mix of semantic and presentational names. It&#8217;s easier to remember .b when you want bold text (but not strong or emphasized text). But my ID names tend to be semantic. </p>

<p>I also take advantage of selector syntax and inheritance rules so that I don&#8217;t have to use as many classes.</p>

							<p>I think I&#8217;m in a comfortable spot between level 5 and 6. The quote in level 5 is something that&#8217;s on my mind a lot when coding a website. Because of this question, I also tend to think about new elements that could be added to the language. I&#8217;m just not the person to write the docs. Hixie probably does a better job with XHTML5 ;)</p>

							<p>I&#8217;m definitely at a level 5. I started back in &#8216;94, took about 6 years off after &#8216;98, and it took a while to adjust to the new way of doing things. I&#8217;m so glad too. All the ideas for sites I had back then are now possible.</p>

							<p>Wow, everyones a Level 5!</p>

<p>I would try and guess what level I am at, but frankly, a lot of the attributes described at various levels fit me. I love my Dreamweaver, though I hand code almost everything in it.
I routinely call elements tags, but semantics and structure are my first thoughts when building a page.
And I actually attempt to support IE, so Im sure that knocks down my uber-coder level down a bit from a Level 5 mage to a Level 2 Druid-squire, or whatever other ultra-nerd terminology that fits.</p>

<p>BTW, what level is this quote:
&#8220;How do I add an image to MySpace? Is it Greater-Than IMAGE equals photobucket.com then the image Less-Than?&#8221;</p>

							<p>I love the typical quote for Level 5. I&#8217;ve lost track of the number of times I&#8217;ve sat and considered that. The old unordered versus ordered chesnut is one of those ‘the more you think about it, the harder it becomes to see the answer’ problems :)</p>

<p>Whilst I don&#8217;t think I ever want to hit Level 6, though some healthy criticism of the specs never goes astray. Once you start <em>sensibly</em> thinking about what&#8217;s right wrong with the specs, you&#8217;re able to properly consider why certain things are the way they are, and by extension to explain them to others. Of all the web developers out there, how many can explain why the class attribute (as an example) should be used just as semantically as the rest of the mark-up (and I don&#8217;t mean ‘because grey1 looks nasty as a class-name’)?</p>

							<p>I&#8217;ve actually had a <em>web design</em> teacher who was somewhere between lvl 0 and lvl 1. Half way into the school year he read a book written by someone who had read w3c guidelines and misinterpreted them, and then our teacher misinterpreted the misinterpretations&#8230; He also gave us a CSS assignment on our last test, despite never actually having taught us anything on the topic. </p>

<p>I do agree there&#8217;s a gap between lvl 4 and 5 since there are people who doesn&#8217;t use XHTML 1.1 for coolness or divs+spans for tabular data, and still isn&#8217;t on the whole structure/presentation/behaviour separation philosophy&#8230; Mostly people who more or less do the right thing, but doesn&#8217;t take enough interest in the discussion of which element is more appropriate for every tiny little situation.</p>

							<p>I&#8217;m somewhere between 4 and 5. I avoid transitional doctypes like the plague, and go with XHTML over HTML because I think XHTML is future-proof. Where possible I validate to XHTML 1.1 to be extra future-proof. I know that table-based layouts are bad and sincerely want to build CSS-based layouts, but if I don&#8217;t go with somebody&#8217;s pre-existing CSS template nothing turns out right and I get very angry. I  like to spend time cleaning up my code, but don&#8217;t like to spend time thinking about what&#8217;s more appropriate. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to get a handle on how positioning works, but all of my from-scratch implementations have serious cross-browser issues. Sometimes the problem lies with IE, but sometimes it lies with Firefox. IMHO there&#8217;s not enough resources available for people stuck between 4 and 5. I know the difference between good and bad, but need help getting good to look good.</p>

							<p>I like these &#8220;levels&#8221; things&#8230; not that they really matter or anything but it gives me a way to gauge where I fall on the charts. It means more coming from sources like this - on accounta how I look up to y&#8217;all &#8216;n everything ;)</p>

<p>I&#8217;d put myself at around 4.5 - I understand much of the semantics side of things and have a pretty good idea of when to use what. Unfortunately (?) I&#8217;m a very presentationally-oriented (there&#8217;s a phrase) designer. So I end up making my layout in Photoshop and then spending hours trying desperately trying to take my layout and make it semantic and pretty. Like right now, I&#8217;m trying to do a worn (ala Cameron) layout with fluid goodness&#8230; What I&#8217;ve got isn&#8217;t tag soup but there&#8217;s a whole lot of divs in there to do the fluid backgrounds and wrappers.</p>

<p>4.5 with occasional lapses in judgement.</p>

							<p>@Scott: XHTML is not &#8220;future-proof&#8221;. XHTML 2 will incompatible with 1.1. Besides, if you&#8217;re serving your (X)HTML with a meta content-type of text/html, then the browser is interpretting your (X)HTML as HTML anyhow, so using XHTML is, in my humble opinion, about as close to useless as possible. I agree with the concept of XHTML, but unless you need to embed MathML in your pages or something like that, HTML 4.01 Strict is about as uber-cool as you get :) I&#8217;m at level 5, I guess, but sometimes I wish I were level -1: &#8220;the intar-what?&#8221;.

							<p>I think what bothers me about Level 1 is they generally don&#8217;t know anything about semantics either; which means you can&#8217;t give them the average WYSIWYG interface and expect decent output. They need to be taught a very small level of semantics to get that bit right; alternatively the WYSIWYG has to be locked down tight as hell to ensure they can&#8217;t stuff it all up.</p>

<p>The real stumble is the average WYSIWYG is not locked down much at all, and happily spits out font tags, b, i, etc&#8230;</p>

							<p>I think I&#8217;m something of a blend between 4 and 5. I hang on IRC a lot, among other channels a HTML channel, for a small swedish forum. Lot of the users are 3-4, they get that divs are better in some way, and that they shouldn&#8217;t use tables for layout, but they haven&#8217;t grasped why, yet. That has to be, in some way, the hardest step to take, &#8216;cause it doesn&#8217;t just make you learn a few new tags or what does what in a HTML-page, but it demands that you start thinking more about why you&#8217;re using the tag, why are you nesting in a certain way, why are you using this tag and not the other and what&#8217;s the difference. You have to get in to a, for some people, different way of thinking. It&#8217;s not just putting a few containers here and there to get the text showing or being in a certain style.</p>

<p>I feel that the people at level 4 are the ones that are striving to be better, to get to learn everything a little bit more. They feel that they&#8217;ve learned quite a lot, but not enough, and often they feel that there&#8217;s people that are a lot better, and they want to be like them. Probably the only level that really, really wants to get better.</p>

							<p>An addition to my post:</p>

<p>The choice i make between tables, css, div layouts depends solely on what the intention of the site should be. </p>

<p>Sometimes tables are a good idea, sometimes div&#8217;s and sometimes pure css. That is seen from my own practical point of view. My own site i builded in 1 day and uses mainly tables. Why? -> why not?. The main idea was to present a quick sketch of what i do. It is also not optimized for SE&#8217;s because every client i ever got in 7 years was always from reference. (even with SE-ized sites i previously had). So i won&#8217;t see any reason why i should build it otherwise.</p>

<p>Take a look at E-bay for instance, are they accessible? still &#8220;tagsoup galore&#8221;. </p>

<p>The people who build e-bay should be on level 3-4 ?</p>

<p>IMHO:</p>

<p>Think there is more to explore, and to question oneself the neccesity and use of building it always the level 5 way?</p>

							<p>Between 4 and 5 here.
While I look for UI aesthetics (always), I make sure that my code is clean and understandable.</p>

<p>I am still on four mainly because I tend to use div tags a lot&#8230; I don&#8217;t think is a bad thing when you really have a need for a div, but I am surely against it when you, for instance, should use &#8216;span&#8217;, or &#8216;p&#8217; &#8230; I said &#8216;p&#8217; because I&#8217;ve seen people use &#8216;div&#8217; to enclose a paragraph&#8230; and such behaviors make me cringe. =)</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time making sure that my code looks pretty.</p>

<p>The level 2 quote: &#8220;The controls I drag and drop in my IDE work fine in Internet Explorer, so why should I have to even look at the HTML?&#8221; is sooooo true. </p>

<p>MS people say that VisualStudio 2005 will be less intrusive and more standards compliant oriented&#8230; I can&#8217;t wait to see that. =)</p>

							<p>I&#8217;m probably a 3.5 level.  I know a bit about spans and divs and uls - but I&#8217;d rather use a table to build a table.</p>

<p>My question is - where do the good web developers fit?  None of these levels sound any good.  Levels 5 and 6 seem too stuck on themselves to do anyone any real good.  Levels 0 - 2 seem like they are too dumb to do any real good.  And levels 3 and 4 sound just competitent enough to do some real damage.  How about a level C for Credible? or for Content Creator.  Or Clued in.</p>

							<p>There&#8217;s an additional low level that I (and a number of my coworkers) are in.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s skill level is somewhere around a level 2 or 3, but have never touched a GUI and probably never will.   We use vi to author pages that look just as good on pre-graphic cell phones as they do on these newfangled graphic monitors; and wonder why all these other developers put in all these img tags that don&#8217;t display on our lynx browsers.</p>

<p>I only with the Level5 and L6 guys realized that they too could author content that&#8217;s readable on lynx &#8212; but they don&#8217;t, instead creating pages that look like &#8220;document.write(whatever)&#8221; when I try to access them.</p>

							<p>I would honestly put myself somewhere between Levels 3 and 5, but not a strict 4. </p>

<p>I think there are elements of all those types of thinking, owrkflow, etc. in my daily routine. There are some elements that have been working for me for so long that I see no need to change them until currentl browsers decide to no longer support them.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wish that I was a pure L5, but then at the same time, sometimes I wish I was a L1. It&#8217;s almost like I am never quite good enough for myself, but customers are fine with the way I create their sites and the sites are clean and functional&#8230; I dunno, but I hate WYSIWYG editors that&#8217;s for sure.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m personally a Level 3 since I didn&#8217;t feel compelled to play with CSS through the 90&#8217;s. It wasn&#8217;t until a recent project design that I did break away from tables for div&#8217;s, and even then an outside developer did most of it.

							<p>Sorry for not using the Markdown syntax, I had no idea why not HTML and simply drowned into catatonia. This is not funny. You did make a few  worthy points, but the rest is too overdone - if you are trying to be ironic, check your facts first. And grammar ;-} (that <em>was</em> that kind of joke - not funny).</p>

<p>First, you should numer these levels the other way. Won&#8217;t get into that, though.</p>

<p>I will use your nomenclature for the benefit of the reader.</p>

<p>HTML LEVEL 0 - what did you expect? Ever seen a text in a language (like, say French when all you know is Chinese Mandarin) that is alien to you? It&#8217;s normal they look, feel and behave baffled. So would you&#8230;</p>

<p>HTML LEVEL 1 - Postscript can be processed by scripts - like Tcl and TeX. Nobody does it by hand (often) for a reason - you can surely guess it :-}. Oh, your categories don&#8217;t make any sense. I shall stop using them except as labels for a new paragraph.</p>

<p>HTML LEVEL 2 - You are making fun of people who do not exist. Go and see the generated code for modern IDE (I consider my text editor an IDE, but what I mean is something like Apple iWeb). It may be not very pretty. Go use Tidy and it will be pretty. Web daemons do not mind. They like to process markup. It&#8217;s in their nature. Really!</p>

<p>HTML LEVEL 3 (or 4, I don&#8217;t mind, do you?) - You are insulting people who push the whole industry forward by making mistakes and yet still experimenting with production level code. See Google Labs. They explore. Spending an hour on a piece of CSS just to make it look neat is like gardening. There&#8217;s really nothing wrong with it and you do something useful on many levels without effort!</p>

<p>HTML LEVEL WHATEVERWHENEVER (Sorry, I changed my mind, assume next in series) - XHTML is important. It is important that there are people who care and learn new things (see previous paragraph, recursion warning).</p>

<p>HTML LEVEL do you know what semantic&#8230;oh&#8230;Quoth: Hmm. I wonder which type of list is the most semantic way to mark up this part of my document. I fail to see anything especially funny in this sentence. Someone help me. Hey, people down there&#8230;More power to you? So shall it it be. And there was power a-plenty for 50 microseconds, otherwise someone could take notice and be cruel by pointing out how very not stupid is { this } :-}.</p>

<p>Sorry everyone - I know I&#8217;m feeding a troll, but people have to help each other, maybe next time someone will feed you (extreme pun intended for those who know why I exercised Temperance, no wrong feelings projected toward target of my creation).</p>

<p>I would place myself solidly as a 5.5.

<p>Doesn&#8217;t this make level 5 people somewhat of a purist at times, perhaps such as insisting that a footer-text-navigation with 2-3 links MUST be a ul and never a p?</p>

<p>I suspect I&#8217;m level 5, but I&#8217;m not really a purist. Or maybe you would think that I&#8217;m just at lvl 4 pretending to be a 5.</p>

							<p>The author is clearly only at Level 3, as beyond that it descends into some kind of meaningless fuzziness. It seems to drift away from the precise nature of a markup language and into the warm cudddly world of design.</p>

<p>The major oversight, imho, is no mention of the DOM. Professional HTML authors/manipulators think in terms of DOM graphs and trees; any other &#8216;view&#8217; simply does not cross their minds.
This is closely followed up by the realtime manipulation of their HTML (which is still HTML  authoring) using Javascript in response to user/system events.</p>

							<p>Level 5 Transistional myself.</p>

<p>Since it takes more than one Level 5 member to have an <em>&#8220;endless discussion anout tiny markup details&#8221;</em> and level 5 is a little lonely at work - I&#8217;m not sure I qualify for Level 5 Strict.</p>

<p>Our markup tends to suffer from the typical of Level 4 <em>div mania</em> described (and an unhealthly shade of classitis). But I guess that is good considering our developers are happilly propped up at around Level 2 by Visual Studio.</p>

							<p>I learned to code by hand before I touched a WYSIWYG editor (Dreamweaver, in my case), so I guess that puts me roughly at level 3 (my first teacher was REALLY old-school, spacer gifs and all).  I had fallen away from hand-coding for a while, but I&#8217;ve found myself coming back to it lately.  I&#8217;m making steps into level 4 territory now, since I&#8217;m teaching myself CSS and learning the whole div vs. table thing.  I admit, with a slight bit of embarrassment amongst all the level 5s, that I have no idea why a div is better than a table, but you have to start somewhere, right?  So now I&#8217;m working on becoming &#8220;real&#8221; 4 and shooting eventually for 5.  6 just makes my brain hurt at this point, and I don&#8217;t know that such rarefied territory is really a goal for me, at least not now&#8230;ask me again when I can call myself a level 5 too.</p>

							<p>Oh-My-God! </p>

<p>My first blog comment ever! </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working in the industry for 10+ years as a web developer/designer and it&#8217;s starting to hurt my brains. Every new kid on the block or old school (HTML 3.2) designer/developer thinks he/she is the hottest shit (some times true)!</p>

<p>Thank god we have well written books and good web sites so that every one can now state they are master of this and that. I truly belive that once you hop on to the &#8220;web&#8221; as a developer/designer, your journey has just begon (still learning something new every week/month).</p>

<p>I noticed a decade ago that publicity is bad (blogs, web sites, web archive, google), or at least I didn&#8217;t need it (I live in Finland, and no, no raindeers in Helsinki). But now-a-days, it&#8217;s so easy to check one persons comments or opinios (and lies!) on the internet (even google it!). So think before you act or if you act before you think, I hope you are sitting on a stedy job (Yes, even the worst recruiters sometimes read &#8220;The Internet&#8221;). </p>

<p>No, I will not state my &#8220;level&#8221;. Go figure..</p>

<p>I know, I allready regret that I even wrote all this <em>*</em>*. Peace, love and all that shit ;)</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re already a level 5 then why would you be wasting your time reading every single comment? You&#8217;re demoted to a level 3.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody in the print world edits PostScript code by hand, so why should the web be any different?&#8221;</p>

<p>are right on target!  They understand that the web is about the solid presentation of killer content.  NOT about who&#8217;s open standard, open source, open blah blah blah conforms to the ideals of some academic body of social rejects who couldn&#8217;t run a lemonaid stand if their life depended on it!</p>

<p>If CSS and XHTML are the Gold standards, the visual development suites should be judged accordingly.  It should NOT take a coder to create formatted web content.  Coding energy should be reserved for the part of Web 2.0 applications that absolutely can&#8217;t be done in a development platform.</p>

<p>Do you have a clue what you&#8217;re talking about? Open-source has nothing (or very little) to do with web development. It&#8217;s best not to criticize something you don&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p>As for the main article, I&#8217;m sorry to rip it apart like this, but I have seen a point I agree with on a web devlopment forum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HTML is used to display a web page. There&#8217;s just so much you can do with it, that there&#8217;s no need to have this level crap to begin with.

  <li><p>I know how to use CSS effectively.</p></li>
  <li><p>I want HTML to do more.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>You&#8217;re not a web designer if you&#8217;re in the first two (even someone using Dreamweaver has an idea of what the tags to if he actually does it for a living). So that leaves three levels that you&#8217;ll see in any language: beginner, intermediate, advanced. That&#8217;s about it.</p>

							<p>Great article&#8230;   </p>

<p>I see myself as a level 4. I was taught back in school how to code in notepad (probably because the school couldn&#8217;t afford Frontpage at the time!) and have never taken a second glance at any WYSIWYG editor! Now (a bit late I realise) I&#8217;ve started looking at the idea of standards and xhtml/css, but I&#8217;m only just getting the hang of it! Ooh, and I love to show off when a site I make validates! Good thing I&#8217;m doing it for fun rather than a job at the moment!   </p>

<p>I hope I will make a decent level 5, but I know it will take time to sort out when and where I use my divs!   </p>

<p>Just a quick question here, do any top web designers use WYSIWYG editors?</p>

							<p>I know I&#8217;m late, but: I don&#8217;t really see why the spec writers should be on a higher level than the &#8220;regular&#8221; web professional. (Hey, <em>I</em> know it is fun. j/k, too. ;)) They are just producers and consumers, neither of them in any way &#8220;higher&#8221; than the other. (Maybe I should say meta-producer and producer, since web developers use the products (specs) of others to produce web sites.)</p>

<p>However, I would consider myself level 5, too. Actually, the thing about transitional and strict doctype I only learned reading your article <a href="http://24ways.org/advent/transitional-vs-strict-markup" rel="nofollow">Transitional vs. Strict Markup</a> over at 24 ways.</p>

							<p>Comfortably at level 5 now, but when I started my web dev business last June I was a sad little 3. I&#8217;ve read that there are 4 levels of competency for any subject:</p>

<ol>
<li>unconsciously incompetent</li>
<li>consciously incompetent</li>
<li>consciously competent</li>
<li>unconsciously competent</li>

							<p>In reality, there&#8217;s a divergent track starting at Level 4 for web developers who deliver what their customers want instead of being slaves to purist expectations and producing perfect &#8220;semantic&#8221; code that almost nobody will appreciate. It&#8217;s all about what your site looks like and how people use it. If people like your site and keep coming back, you&#8217;ve got a great site&#8212;there&#8217;s no way around this. On the other hand, being technically perfect doesn&#8217;t guarantee anything if your content sucks and there&#8217;s nothing &#8220;sticky&#8221; on the site.</p>

<p>MySpace is a great example of what many designers would call a poorly designed site, but it delivers the goods and people seem to love it.</p>

<p>If you want to consider how technical enhancements to your site will really improve it, consider first how to 1) provide clear, contextual navigation around your site (difficulty of navigation is the #1 problem of websites in my experience); 2) enhance SEO as much as possible (multiple techniques for this); 3) give people something to do with other people (interactivity!). Perfect semantic markup is #99 or thereabouts.</p>

							<p>Interesting entry.  While I agree that we need more &#8220;level 5s&#8221; out there doing stuff, what I think should be the target of some software developers is making an easy-to-use, standards and semantics-based XHTML editor.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m not up to date on WYSIWYG editors (as I don&#8217;t use them), it would be nice to see such an application, as it would allow even novices to output sites that are standards compliant, that would make the web a better place.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it: There will always be people who want to put up content on the web but don&#8217;t care all too much about web standards - I don&#8217;t blame them for this, often time or other constraints matter more.  That&#8217;s why a properly-designed, easy-to-use, standards-compliant editor could help a lot in this area.  I know it wouldn&#8217;t be easy to make, but rarely is that such the case with properly-designed software. </p>

Everything I&#8217;ve learned has been solely out of curiosity and while I&#8217;ve occassionally used a bit of my HTML knowledge at work, it&#8217;s not enough to justify the amount of time I spend on it! Still, it keeps me out of trouble so I can&#8217;t complain.</p>

							<p>Nice post! :-)</p>

<p>I read the article with great interest.</p>

<p>Someone above me was right - you could mark 10 or 20 levels - but I would ask - <em>why</em>? Is that necessary? I think you hitthe point, and marked up all of us designers quite clearly;-)</p>

<p>Still, I think, Level 5 could be devided in 5A- and 5A and 5A+, because there are slight differences in the knowledge at the same level:) And this is the most advanced (I won&#8217;t comment on &#8220;6&#8221;, it&#8217;s for maniacs;-) - so it could be looked at with greater detail.</p>

<p>Thus, Dan Cederholm and Douglas Bowman, for example, would fall strictly into 5A+, and I would classify myself something between 5A- and 5A:)))</p>



<p>Well, I read all of these &#8220;specs&#8221; with much interest, and I see I drop exactly at <strong>Level 5</strong>. So I think;-)</p>

<p>I write semantic (X)HTML and nice CSS for more than 2 years (even 3, I guess).</p>

<p>But I wouldn&#8217;t aim for Level 6, I don&#8217;t think so:) I am so happy with five&#8230;</p>

<p>I create simple, effective, clean, usable designs, I separate content from presentation as much as I can, use nice graphics which complement the html structure in a nice and non-obtrusive way, and if using fancy stuff like JS, always try to make the SAME thing work, even if JS is disabled/non-present! :-)
[Example: add nice pop-up effects for gallery on the website, but if JS is not present, the links from thumbnails simply lead to larger image files.]</p>

<p>And&#8230; OK, OK, I know&#8230; my visit card is my website, but unfortunately, with so much work lately I can&#8217;t concentrate on it and just keep workin&#8217; for others:-( Ahh, Designer&#8217;s Fate&#8230;</p>

<p>Still, if interested in what I do and why I pretend Level 5, you better drop a look at <a href="http://www.cantarco.de" rel="nofollow">http://www.cantarco.de</a>  (Ensemble Cantarco) - one of my latest projects I did for a friend in The Netherlands:-)</p>



<p>Now, what about creating similar specification for CSS 2? :-)</p>

<p>Waiting&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. :-)</p>

							<p>Hi, shame on me, I<code>m level 0 ;-), but I</code>m a user, so should not be a problem. I think the most important problem based on the levels above is, that a lot of people selling Internet programming as a service are only on level 2 to 4, they use software to built up the page, but they have realy no imagination what is going on with the code. This is my feeling out of the view of a customer. </p>

							<p>I almost don&#8217;t know a person without a personal site (or just a web page) already so most people I know are at least level 2. Ok, my grandmother and grandfather are level 0 but I just don&#8217;t count them :).
I personally am a graphic/web designer but I just can&#8217;t stand to know &#8220;a little&#8221; about something, I just have to be good at everything I am interested in(yes, I am modest too;). So currently I am level 4 and I will continue educating myself till I get to level 5 and I can call myself a web developer too. Still, I don&#8217;t know if I will ever get to level 6 since I am more of a &#8220;presentation is important too&#8221; person than &#8220;structure and semantics matter the most&#8221; person.</p>
