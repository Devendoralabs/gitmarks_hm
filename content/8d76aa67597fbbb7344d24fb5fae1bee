<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

<p>These notes are a miscellany of grammatical <a 
href="r.html#rules">rules</a> and explanations, comments on <a 
href="s.html#style">style</a>, and suggestions on <a 
href="u.html#usage">usage</a> I put together for my classes. 
Nothing here is carved in stone, and many comments are matters of 
<a href="t.html#taste">personal preference</a> &#0151; feel free 
to psychoanalyze me by examining my particular hangups and 
<em>b&ecirc;tes noires</em>. Anyone who can resist turning my own 
preferences into <a href="b.html#bugbears">dogma</a> is welcome 
to use this HTML edition. <a href="comments.html">Feedback</a> is 
always welcome.</p>

<p>I should be clear up front: I'm not a linguist, nor a scholar 
of the history of the language. (If you're curious about who I 
am, you can look at my <a 
href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/CV.pdf">CV</a> and 
decide whether I'm worth listening to.) Linguists are wary of "<a 
href="p.html#prescriptive">prescriptive</a>" grammars, which set 
out standards of "correct" and "incorrect" usage &#0151; grammars 
that usually insist correctness reigned in the good old days, 
whereas we've been on the road to hell ever since. Professional 
linguists are adamant that the language isn't "declining," and 
that many usages censured by self-styled grammarians are in fact 
perfectly reasonable, whether on historical grounds, logical 
grounds, or both.</p>

<p>And they're right. I reject any model of linguistic decline, 
in which the twenty-first century speaks a decadent version of 
the language of some golden age. I don't lie awake at night 
worrying about the decline of "proper" English. (In my grumpier 
moods, I'm convinced the whole world's going to hell &#0151; but 
then, I'm convinced the whole world's been going to hell since 
time out of mind. In my more sanguine moods, I wonder whether 
hell isn't such a bad place to be after all.) I know, too, that 
many things offered as "good" grammar or style have little basis 
in history or in logic.</p>


<h3 align="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</h3>

<p>Why, then, have I spent so much time on a prescriptive and 
fairly traditional usage guide? Because these notes may be useful 
in making your writing <em>clearer</em> and more 
<em>effective</em>. I'm not out to make definitive statements 
about what's <em>right</em> and what's <em>wrong</em>, and Lord 
knows I wouldn't be qualified even if I tried. I can, however, 
make suggestions on things that are likely to <em>work</em> 
&#0151; by which, as you'll see throughout this guide, I mean 
<em>have an effect on your <a 
href="a.html#audience">audience</a></em>.</p>

<p>The entries here are of two types: specific articles on <a 
href="u.html#usage">usage</a>, and more general articles on <a 
href="s.html#style">style</a>. The specific articles cover such 
<a href="m.html#mechanics">mechanical</a> things as when to use a 
<a href="s.html#semicolon">semicolon</a> and what a <a 
href="d.html#dangling">dangling participle</a> is; the general 
articles discuss ways to make "proper" writing even better. The 
specific articles can be further divided into two classes: (1) <a 
href="g.html#grammar">grammatical</a> rules and matters of <a 
href="h.html#house">house style</a>, matters rather of precedent 
than of taste; and (2) more subjective suggestions for making 
your writing <a href="c.html#clarity">clearer</a>, more forceful, 
and more <a href="g.html#grace">graceful</a>. The specific 
articles are intended for quick reference, such as when you have 
to find out whether <a href="t.html#that"><em>which</em> or 
<em>that</em></a> is appropriate. The general articles lend 
themselves to browsing and absorbing over time.</p>

<p>These general articles are no less important than the "<a 
href="r.html#rules">rules</a>." In fact, really bad writing is 
rarely a matter of broken rules &#0151; editors can clean these 
up with a few pencil marks. It's more often the result of muddled 
thought. Bad writers consider <a href="l.html#long">long 
words</a> more impressive than short ones, and use words like 
<em><a href="u.html#usage">usage</a></em> instead of <em>use</em> 
or <em><a href="m.html#methodology">methodologies</a></em> 
instead of <em>methods</em> without knowing what they mean. They 
qualify everything with <em>It has been noted after careful 
consideration</em>, and the facts get buried under loads of <a 
href="w.html#wasted">useless words</a>. They pay no attention to 
the literal sense of their words, and end up stringing stock 
phrases together without regard for meaning. They use <a 
href="c.html#cliche">clich&eacute;s</a> inappropriately and say 
the opposite of what they mean.</p>

<p>I've tried to steer clear of technical terms and, wherever 
possible, have tried to explain grammatical jargon. This has 
sometimes meant sacrificing precision for convenience; more 
sophisticated writers and grammarians will doubtless see points 
to quibble over, but I hope these notes get the idea across to 
tyros. Every article on points of grammar &#0151; <a 
href="d.html#dangling">dangling participles</a>, <a 
href="s.html#split">split infinitives</a> &#0151; begins with a 
practical definition of the term, followed by some useful rules, 
and examples of good and bad writing. Sometimes there are 
suggestions on how to identify possible problems. The definitions 
and discussions are not exhaustive, just rules of thumb. If you 
need more detail, consider one of the books in the last section, 
"<a href="#additional">Additional Reading</a>."</p>

<hr>

<h2 align=center><a name="additional">Additional Reading</a></h2>

<p>There are countless writing guides, most of them awful. The 
books below are either classics in the field or my own faves.</p>

<ul>

<li>H. W. Fowler, <cite>Modern English Usage</cite>. This 
seven-hundred-page volume of small type includes every 
conceivable stylistic point, arranged alphabetically, and written 
in an informal (but quirky) tone. Some of the entries are 
specific &#0151; several pages on punctuation &#0151; while 
others are general, such as tired clich&eacute;s. Almost every 
entry has illustrative quotations from real life. Fowler was 
qualified for the job, having just compiled the <cite>Concise 
Oxford Dictionary</cite>. Yanks may find this classic work 
unsuitable because of its focus on <a 
href="b.html#british">British English</a>, and much of it has 
been outdated in the eight decades since its first edition's 
completion. Still worth a look. A companion, <cite>Modern 
American Usage</cite> by Follett, makes up for some of Fowler's 
disadvantages, but lacks the charm of the original.

<li>Sir Ernest Gowers <em>et al</em>., <cite>The Complete Plain 
Words</cite>. Ernest Gowers's <cite>Plain Words</cite> is a guide 
to effective writing from the 1940s for British civil servants. 
Over the years it has gone through many editions and been changed 
by many hands. The most recent version, <cite>The Complete Plain 
Words</cite>, still shows its focus on British usage and the 
civil service, but many of its suggestions are excellent. Most of 
the book is a discussion of common writing problems, with 
examples of good and bad writing. There is also a long section on 
specific points of usage, arranged alphabetically.

<li>George Orwell, "Politics and the English Language." Orwell's
essay is one of the great works on the plain style. The essay
should be available in any popular collection of Orwell's essays.
Read it daily. Keep a copy under your pillow.

<li><a name="pinney">Thomas Pinney</a>, <cite>A Short Handbook 
and Style Sheet</cite>. A handy little guide to style, written 
informally and accessibly. The general sections (on diction, 
vagueness, wordiness, and so on) are better than those devoted to 
<a href="m.html#mechanics">mechanics</a>. Pinney's work is 
refreshingly free of dogmatism of any sort.

<li>Margaret Shertzer, <cite>The Elements of Grammar</cite>. Not 
bad if you're looking for very specific rules, but not highly 
recommended as a general guide. It includes things like 
"Capitalize nouns followed by a capitalized Roman numeral" and 
the proper spelling of <em>b&ecirc;te noire</em>. Easily 
available, since it's often sold with Strunk and White (below).

<li><a name="strunk">Strunk and White</a>, <cite>The Elements of 
Style</cite>. The standard high school guide to style, and useful 
well beyond school. It includes a number of specific rules, 
dozens of commonly misused words, and bundles of suggestions for 
improving your style. Available anywhere (now including an <a 
href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/">on-line version</a> of 
Strunk's 1918 edition). Read it. Memorize it. Live it.

<li><a name="nurnberg">Maxwell Nurnberg</a>, <cite>I Always Look 
Up the Word "Egregious": A Vocabulary Book for People Who Don't 
Need One</cite>. A pleasant guide to building vocabulary that 
never becomes patronizing (the fault of too many books for 
beginners) or drifts off into utterly useless long words (the 
fault of too many books for fans of word games). It's probably 
too sophisticated for non-native speakers and rank beginners, but 
will help many others build a more powerful vocabulary.

<li><cite>The American Heritage Dictionary</cite>, 4th ed. Not 
only a good desk dictionary for providing definitions, but also a 
handy guide to usage on controversial questions. <cite>AHD</cite> 
has a panel of writers who vote on whether certain usages are 
acceptable.

<li>Lynne Truss, <cite>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero 
Tolerance Approach to Punctuation</cite>. It's not a 
comprehensive treatise to answer all your questions, and it 
describes British rather than American practice (well, practise). 
And the "zero-tolerance" stuff shouldn't be taken too seriously. 
But the book's a hoot, and if you're curious about the finer 
points of punctuation, check it out.
