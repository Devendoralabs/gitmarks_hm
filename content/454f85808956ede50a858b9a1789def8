    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This exploratory study investigated data-gathering behaviors exhibited by 100 seventh-grade students as they participated in a scientific inquiry-based curriculum project delivered by a multi-user virtual environment (MUVE). This research examined the relationship between students&rsquo; self-efficacy on entry into the authentic scientific activity and the longitudinal data-gathering behaviors they employed while engaged in that process. Three waves of student behavior data were gathered from a server-side database that recorded all student activity in the MUVE; these data were analyzed using individual growth modeling. The study found that self-efficacy correlated with the number of data-gathering behaviors in which students initially engaged, with high self-efficacy students engaging in more data gathering than students with low self-efficacy. Also, the impact of student self-efficacy on rate of change in data gathering behavior differed by gender. However, by the end of their time in the MUVE, initial student self-efficacy no longer correlated with data gathering behaviors. In addition, students&rsquo; level of self-efficacy did not affect how many different sources from which they chose to gather data. These results suggest that embedding science inquiry curricula in novel platforms like a MUVE might act as a catalyst for change in students&rsquo; self-efficacy and learning processes.</p>

 8397. </h4>
    </blockquote>      <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This study examines the patterns of use and potential impact of individualized, reflective guidance in an educational Multi-User Virtual Environment (MUVE). A guidance system embedded within a MUVE-based scientific inquiry curriculum was implemented with a sample of middle school students in an exploratory study investigating (a) whether access to the guidance system was associated with improved learning, (b) whether students viewing more guidance messages saw greater improvement on content tests than those viewing less, and (c) whether there were any differences in guidance use among boys and girls. Initial experimental findings showed that basic access to individualized guidance used with a MUVE had no measurable impact on learning. However, post-hoc exploratory analyses indicated that increased use of the system among those with access to it was positively associated with content test score gains. In addition, differences were found in overall learning outcomes by gender and in patterns of guidance use by boys and girls, with girls outperforming boys across a spectrum of guidance system use. Based on these exploratory findings, the paper suggests design guidelines for the development of guidance systems embedded in MUVEs and outlines directions for further research.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: One-size-fits-all educational innovations do not work because they ignore contextual factors that determine an intervention&rsquo;s efficacy in a particular local situation. Identifying variables within the intervention&rsquo;s setting that represent important conditions for success and summarizing the extent to which the impact of the intervention is attenuated by variation in them can provide prospective adopters of the innovation a better sense of what level of effectiveness they are likely to enjoy in their own particular circumstances. This study presents a research framework on how to conduct such an analysis and how to design educational innovations for scalability through enhancing their adaptability for effective usage in a wide variety of settings. The River City MUVE, a technology-based curriculum designed to enhance engagement and learning in middle school science, is presented as a case study.</p>

The initial survey of 61 items was piloted online first with a sample of 100 students. Revisions were made based on reliability and validity evidence, using Cronbach's alpha, Principal Component Analysis and correlational evidence. Two subscales of the survey were then implemented with over 2000 students participating in a technology in science research project. The final version of the survey consists of six independent sections on self-efficacy in science inquiry and technology (science inquiry, using the Internet to find information, general computer usage, synchronous chat use, videogaming and computer gaming). </p>

    </blockquote>      <p><strong>Abstract </strong>: This National Science Foundation funded study is investigating novel pedagogies for helping teachers infuse inquiry into a standards-based science curriculum. Using a Multi-User Virtual Environment (MUVE) as a pedagogical vehicle, teams of middle school students are asked to collaboratively solve a simulated 19th century city's problems with illness, through interaction with each others' avatars, digital artifacts, tacit clues, and computer-based agents acting as mentors and colleagues in a virtual community of practice. This paper describes the results from the three implementations in 2004 with approximately 2000 students from geographical diverse urban areas. Results indicate that students do conduct inquiry and are motivated by that process. However, results from assessments vary depending on assessment strategy employed. </p>

    </blockquote>      <p><strong>Abstract </strong>: In this paper, we provide an overview of the design of an NSF-funded Multi-User Virtual Environment science curriculum project focusing on the creation of virtual experimentation methods and tools that go beyond a canned lab' approach to concentrate on inquiry, using novel pedagogies to help low-performing students master complex skills. We present findings from students and teachers on the effectiveness of these methods, tools, and virtual contexts in creating an experimental learning environment authentic to what scientists experience in their work. </p>

    </blockquote>      <p><strong>Abstract </strong>: Many researchers are exploring the types of learning that occur in informal out-of school technology use (such as videogame play), yet the content of these environments tends not to align to national standards for academic content. This paper presents research on how a multiuser virtual environment centered on content related to national standards and assessments in biology and ecology offers new types of immersive learning for engaging grades 7 and 8 students in learning science. </p>

    </blockquote>      <p><strong>Abstract </strong>: This NSF-funded project utilizes graphical multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) as a vehicle to study (1) classroom-based situated learning and (2) the ways in which virtual environments may aid the transfer of learning from classroom contexts into real world settings. In the project's River City curriculum, teams of middle school students are asked to collaboratively solve a simulated 19th century city's problems with illness, through interaction with each others' avatars, digital artifacts, tacit visual and auditory clues, and computer-based agents acting as mentors and colleagues in a virtual community of practice. In this paper, we provide an overview of results from a large-scale implementation of the River City environment and curriculum in Spring 2004. Our findings show that students and teachers were highly engaged, that student attendance improved, that disruptive behavior dropped, and that interesting patterns are emerging about which students do best under our various pedagogical conditions. </p>

In the project's River City curriculum, teams of middle school students are asked to collaboratively solve a digital 19th century city's problems with illness, through interaction with digital artifacts, tacit clues, and computer-based agents' acting as mentors and colleagues in a virtual community of practice. This paper describes the design-based research strategy by which we are currently extending an educational MUVE environment and curriculum. Through several iterations of design-based research, we have refined our curriculum, the MUVE environment, and the theories underlying our design. </p>
