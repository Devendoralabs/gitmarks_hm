I know what I did was wrong but please take this letter as something dear from my heart.
&nbsp;
Please forgive me. I should have been a better person and not let my feelings about other matters over shadow, the thoughtfulness of your gift. ***
&nbsp;
It started because of a simple disagreement, And now I seek amendment. For all of the things I&#039;ve done, For all of the things that went gone. I&#039;ve been hard headed, Now I&#039;m alone stranded. In this island full of apologies, And excuses and sorries and pleas. I seek forgiveness from you, But my wish may not come true. I want you to understand, Cause my actions were offhand. Maybe you&#039;re tired of me, My anger, my pride, my jealousy. This time I went too far, So far I lost my star. I&#039;m sorry my princess, I just hope you&#039;d accept this. -crappy poem... But one thing is important... I wrote it wholeheartedly...***
&nbsp;
I am sorry for all the horrible things that you were exposed to I send this token as an olive branch of peace***
&nbsp;
You have the key to my heart and you complete me. If you needed my heart I would give it to you, no questions asked. I love you unconditionally and I never want to do anything to hurt your heart. I know that I do things that make you upset. But nobodys perfect and sometimes we have to take people for what they are. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s something we both need to work on. You are the most amazing man that god has ever made and you are so unquie in so many ways. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s why I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!! Sometimes I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know what exactly I do to make you so upset and I wished you would talk to me instead of pushing me away. I want nothing more then to be with you and that can only happen if we BOTH work at this. I know I hurt you and I feel so bad, For saying things and making you sad.. It&#039;s just that my love for you is so great, I want to be with you, I just can&#039;t wait. Its hard loving a person who is only a friend, what am I supposed to say when I want us to way back when. You are so special, one of a kind, I could look forever and never find, Anyone else as wonderful as you, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve made that mistake and never will again, because the person I want to be with is almost in the palm of my hand.. Please forgive me for things I said, I love you so much, Its just a messed in my head.. You are my life. My very breathe, I promise to love you, even after death.. So if you can forgive this broken hearted friend, You&#039;ll never see that part of me again.. I&#039;ll love you and take care of you for infinity, We&#039;ll make it, together, just you and me.. I mean every word that I say, and even though on certain days, I may seem upset or sad and cry, I hope that you will always be by my side. I want to be with you through whatever may come, but we need to work on listening to eachothers words some. I hope that this apology makes you wanna at least talk to me, but if not I will never give up on thee. I love you to death and want the world to know that im in love with you.</div>
