              <strong>The setup

 
<br>
            </strong><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_41/b4004401.htm?chan=search" target="_blank">Design
            Schools are the new Business Schools</a>, according to
              the October 9, 2006 issue of BusinessWeek magazine. Traditional
              business models are failing in the face of global competition,
              and American companies are scouring design schools for design-innovators
              to lead them into the twenty-first century with creative strategies.
              Great. But the question is, where will these young designers
              lead us? Will their skills in systems thinking and problem
              solving simply be exploited to make more money for bottom-line
              corporations? Or will these innovators find the courage to
              weave a conscience into their design solutions for corporate
            America. </p>
            <p>And will they know how? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="article_quote">Traditional business models are failing
              in the face of global competition, and American companies are
              scouring design schools for design-innovators to lead them
              into the twenty-first century with creative strategies. Great.
              But the question is, where will these young designers lead
              us?</p>
            <p><strong>Enlightened Innovation<br>
              </strong>The goal of Enlightened Innovation is to unite values
              with design practice to address a set of criteria that is often
                referred to as The Three P's&mdash;people, planet, and profit.
              Many companies have Corporate Social Responsibility programs
              that address The Three P's (or at least two out of the three),
              but they are external from business practice and are often
              managed by PR departments. The Enlightened Innovator finds
              ways to integrate CSR with business practice while maintaining
              its PR punch. </p>
            <p>The skill set of the industrial designer allows a unique perspective
              for this kind of problem solving. &quot;What's fascinating
              about design as an occupation is that you're a bit of a boundary-spanner;
              you've got some knowledge on such a broad spectrum of disciplines&mdash;from
              manufacturing, to production, to marketing&mdash;and can have
              some influence across all of those different areas,&quot; argues
              Joshua Handy, Director of Industrial Design at <a href="http://www.methodhome.com/" target="_blank">Method
              Home</a>,
              an environmentally responsible business, and one of Fortune
              500's fastest growing companies of 2006. &quot;Design is very
              much at the core of what we do here. And the companies that
              are going to make it into the future are the ones adopting
              this approach.&quot; This multidimensional path strives
              for an efficiency that can both benefit businesses economically
              and create responsible business practice that is good for the
            environment and society.</p>
			  
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Design Education<br>
              </strong>So how can young designers prepare to contribute to this changing
                face of business and industry? Many design programs are sending
                their students to business classes in order to learn the language
                of corporations (the most creative thinkers will get nowhere
                if they can't communicate with the people they will be working
                with). But how can young designers learn not only to speak
                this language, but to expand upon its vocabulary toward the
            goal of implementing Triple P strategies? </p>
            <p>Design educators can help. Administrators can help. Students
              can help. Businesses can help. For everyone who wants to do
              good but feels overwhelmed by the question of where to begin,
              here are some starting points. </p>
            <p class="article_quote">&quot;As an educator and&nbsp;strategist,
              I am more optimistic than I have been for a long time. We are
              beginning to 'get it.' But do
              designers feel an urgency? Are they ready to leave styling
            and take on the job of designing a world for over nine billion?&quot; </p>
            <p><strong>1. Start early. </strong> Dr. Mary McBride, Managing
                Partner at Strategies for Planned Change in New York City,
              states, &quot;As an educator and&nbsp;strategist,
                I am more optimistic than I have been for a long time. We
              are beginning to 'get it.' It is a question of time and talent.&quot; But
                she cautions, &quot;Do designers feel an urgency? Are they
                ready to leave styling and take on the job of designing a
                world for over nine billion?&quot; </p>
            <p>Design students may believe that in their future jobs they
              won't have the authority to address important issues. So they
              need to be encouraged in class. It's wrong to assume that freshmen
              cannot handle social issues on top of their other work. But
              if ethics are presented as an additional subject, they may
              seem overwhelming. In his article<em> <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111%2Fj.1467-873X.2004.00281.x" target="_blank">A
              Foucauldian Analysis of Environmental Education</a></em>, David
              Gruenwald argues that uniting values with practice is a necessary
              component to the success of socio-ecological education; students
              must be encouraged at an early stage in their education to
              develop their values right along with their other skills (drawing,
              2d, 3d, software, etc.). </p>
            <p>Dr. Bruce M. Tharp, Assistant Professor in the Department
              of Architecture, Interior Architecture + Designed Objects at
              The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, integrates these
              ideas into his pedagogy: &quot;In my experience, students are
              not only capable of discussing these issues, they are eager.
              At SAIC, my sophomore level studio class must design an object
              to address a 'suffering event,' and my introductory graduate
              studio class must design for an activist or non-profit organization
              as a (speculative) client. These are classes in which students
              are learning basic design skills and principles, but within
              ethically-principled contexts.&quot; </p>
            <p>In projects like these, where design students are encouraged
              early on to tie their own design experiences to their values,
              they are also developing the power to be that much more convincing
              in corporate conversations. And that much more human. </p>
            <p class="article_quote">Designers don't have to be number crunchers per
se, but they need to understand that an
enlightened analysis calls for a wider scope of
considerations than those of traditional
marketing analyses.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Encourage students to ask why.</strong>The late
                cultural critic <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/09/obituaries/09POST.html?ex=1162530000&en=f2aa138ed24027a2&ei=5070" target="_blank">Neil
                Postman</a> argued that our technocratic
                culture is so bedazzled by its technical ability to address
                the question of 'HOW do we make a product?' we have forgotten
                to ask 'WHY?': In <em>Technolopoly: The
                Surrender of Culture to Technology </em>(Knopf, 1992), he
                <a href="http://www.engr.psu.edu/sts/Courses/walton/readings/Post3.PDF" target="_blank">writes</a>,&quot;Alfred
                North Whitehead summed it up best when he remarked that the
                greatest invention of the
                nineteenth century was the idea of invention itself. We had
                learned how to invent things, and the question of why we
                invent things receded in importance. The idea that if something
                could be done it should be done was born in the nineteenth
                century...It also came to be believed that the engine of
                technological progress worked most efficiently when people
                are conceived of not as children of God or even as citizens
                but as consumers&mdash;that is to say, as markets.&quot; And
                this is reflected, of course, in education.
                Eleonore de Lusignan, a junior in the Industrial Design program
                at Rhode Island School of Design, argues that &quot;Design
                schools put stress on the human factors of design; this should
                involve not only the physiology of our users but also the
                environment in which they live. Our design process is too
                focused on how to make a product for a person's lifestyle.
                Instead, we should be asking ourselves why our products are
                beneficial for our users and their environment.&quot; </p>
            <p>At the winnowing stage of a project, students should create
              lists of both positive and negative consequences of their proposed
              solutions, and a brutal list of 'why' and 'why not' to make
              their designs. Then they can make informed choices about whether
              to move forward on their project, or to explore alternative
              avenues. Asking 'why' helps students tie their designs back
              to human concerns and can be an efficient strategy for analyzing
              product development and resources. <br>
            </p>
            <p>                <strong>3. Consider lifecycle and true cost
                analysis for every product. </strong>If young designers are
                going to sell their enlightened innovations successfully,
                they will need to understand and be able to communicate the
                environmental, social, and economic advantages of their proposals.
                In product design, the analysis might be as simple as understanding
                a design's input-to-output ratio. How do the amounts of natural
                resources, energy, distribution costs, and waste management
                measure up to the benefits afforded by the use of a product?
                Designers don't have to be number crunchers per se, but they
                need to understand that an enlightened analysis calls for
                a wider scope of considerations than those of traditional
marketing analyses.</p>            
            <p>&quot;This [type of analysis] has proven very useful to students,
              by creating a clear reference point for considering the full
              lifecycle of something they may design,&quot; states Steve
              Belletire, Associate Professor of Industrial Design at Southern
              Illinois University Carbondale and co-creator of <a href="http://www.idsa.org/whatsnew/sections/ecosection/okala.html" target="_blank">The
              Okala Ecological Design Curriculum</a>. &quot;In short, it
              helps change the way they think about the design process and
              their role within it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>4. Learn to present. </strong>The art of information
              design and promotion is critical to the success of Enlightened
              Innovation. If design students don't have time for graphic
              design electives, they should invest in  good graphic
              design books for the studio library. Design students should
              practice simple and convincing presentation techniques; they
              should design and display visuals that exhibit thoughtful projects,
              well...thoughtfully, employing enlightened analysis as part
              of the project's central impetus, without preaching...and without
            making it into a rote deliverable. </p>            
            <p>&quot;Anyone who is a communicator using visual form&mdash;two
              or three dimensions&mdash;should understand how data clearly
              flows and also how this flow is made graphic and understandable.
              Without clarity, the best ideas in the world are two- and three-dimensional
              gibberish,&quot; argues Steven Heller, co-chair of the School
              of Visual Arts MFA Designer As Author Program. Presentation
              practice will arm design students with the communication skills
              necessary to be convincing in future leadership roles. <br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>5. Recognize the opportunity; start big. </strong>Corporate
              America is inviting designers to the table, and invitations&mdash;at
              least the good ones!&mdash;are chock full of opportunities. Designers
              can take advantage of these opportunities by insinuating their
              concerns (call them priorities) about people, the environment,
              and responsible corporate strategy into their initial meetings.
              In education, that means encouraging big questions right from
              the get-go, so that the bars are set high. It
              is part of the designer's role to help set the agenda for any
              design engagement, as long as the arguments are made with an
              informed perspective. And asking the big questions first will
              set up an ambitious scope and a positive intention. Not a bad
            start.</p>
			  
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Final thoughts<br>
              </strong>The opportunity is real, but so is the danger: Will
              tomorrow's designers have the desire&mdash;but not the skills necessary&mdash;to
                steer enlightened business strategies? Our challenge in education
                is to provide for them experiences that will create and refine
                a value-based design education with the confidence that they
                will be able to promote this approach throughout their professional
            years. </p>
