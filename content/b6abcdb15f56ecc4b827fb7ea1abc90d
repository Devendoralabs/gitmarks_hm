Broadband</b></p><p><b>Monday, November 15, 2010</b></p><p>Like
electricity a century ago, broadband is a foundation for economic growth,
job creation, global competitiveness and a better way of life. It is
enabling entire new industries and unlocking vast new possibilities for
existing ones. It is changing how we educate children, deliver health
care, manage energy, ensure public safety, engage government, and access,
organize and disseminate knowledge. But broadband in America is not all it
needs to be.</p><p>The Institute for Information Law &amp; Policy hosted a
discussion with NYLS Alum, Claude Aiken &lsquo;08, surrounding his role at
the FCC. Mr. Aiken is Legal Counsel to the Senior Advisor to Chairman on
Broadband at the FCC, where he advises the Chairman&rsquo;s office on
issues relating to the National Broadband Plan. Prior to this, he was an
Honors Program attorney in the Wireline Competition Bureau where he
focused on broadband competition and universal service issues. He also
serves as a board member and general counsel for 100cameras, Inc., a
non-profit that uses photography to help underprivileged youth.</p><hr

2010</strong></p><p>Professor Markovits, a world-renowned scholar, spoke
about his latest work titled, Gaming the World: How Sports are Reshaping
Global Politics and Culture (Princeton University Press,
2010).</p><p>ABOUT THE BOOK:  Professional Sports today have truly become
a global force, a common language that anybody, regardless of their
nationality, can understand.  Yet sports also remain distinctly local,
with regional teams and the fiercely loyal local fans that follow them. 
Gaming the World examines the 21st century phenomenon of global sports, in
which professional teams and their players have become agents of
globalization, while at the same time fostering deep-seated and
antagonistic local allegiances, and spawning new forms of cultural
conflict and prejudice.</p><p>To watch the video of this event click <a

/><p><strong> Right of Publicity in Sports Video
Games</strong></p><p><strong>Thursday, October 14, 2010<br
/></strong></p><p>Sports video games have always placed an emphasis on
having realistic representations of your favorite players.  But what
happens when in creating that realistic environment, a sports star's
identity is used without their permission?  How far does an athlete's
right to control the commercial value of their identity go?  Does the
First Amendment protect the video game developers' attempt at recreating
the skill set, aesthetic features, and overall identity of another person
as an expressive work? <br />Guest lecturer Tim McIlwain '95 discussed
right of publicity issues relating to professional athletes and their
depiction in video games and other sports-related intellectual property
issues.</p><hr /><p><strong>Innovate / Activate: An Unconference on IP and
Activism</strong></p><p><strong>September 24-25, 2010 @ New York Law
School</strong></p><p>Innovation is unquestionably important to society.
Intellectual property regimes seek to provide incentives for such
innovation. Understanding the inter-working of intellectual property
regimes and innovation may lead to conclusions that such regimes are not
working well, or at all, in encouraging innovation. When such failures are
perceived, active communities form to address the shortcomings. Many
communities have formed around issues such as free speech vs copyright;
the importance of fair use; alternative licensing regimes such as Creative
Commons or free and open source software; patent protection of software and
business methods; and patents vs downstream innovation of critical
pharmaceuticals.</p><p>While these approaches have been exceedingly
important in bringing about needed change, many successful groups have
devised strategies that balance the extent to which activists work within
existing innovation systems in order to achieve their goals, as they
continue to explore the necessity of circumventing those systems. At the
same time, the increased production of and focus on IP in all industries
has catalyzed the emergence of IP obstacles in areas where IP has
traditionally not been a consideration, thus creating new areas for
activism. It&rsquo;s time to reexamine our approaches to improving global
welfare by identifying new and existing IP-related challenges to activism,
developing strategies for overcoming IP obstacles, and delivering practical
solutions to spur social, political, environmental, scientific,
technological and legal change.</p><p>The Institute for Information Law
&amp; Policy at New York Law School is proud to present Innovate /
Activate, a two-day unconference, cosponsored by the Information Society
Project at Yale Law School, where IP practitioners and activists will
share their ideas and experiences in order to transform the landscape of
activism.</p><p>More details at <a

2010 <br /></strong></p><p>Interested in practicing Intellectual Property
law? Want to learn what it takes to be a solo practitioner in this
field?</p><p>Mark J. Ingber has 18 years experience practicing in the
field of Intellectual Property, focusing substantially on trademark and
copyright law. Mr. Ingber has worked diligently to present his firm,
Ingber &amp; Gelber, LLP of Millburn, New Jersey, as an effective, cost
efficient alternative to the larger Intellectual Property firms.</p><p>Mr.
Ingber has devised progressive litigation strategies that have proved
successful in securing favorable resolutions for his clients. For example,
Mr. Ingber filed a declaratory judgment action in hometown New Jersey
Federal Court, after his client, New Jersey based advertising company Ad
Magic, Inc., received a cease and desist letter from a California company.
On the basis of this &ldquo;pre-emptive strike&rdquo; legal strategy, the
jury returned a unanimous verdict on behalf of Ad Magic, Inc. and against
Advertising Magic, of Walnut Grove, California. Specifically, the Jury
found that Advertised Magic failed to prove that a &ldquo;likelihood of
confusion,&rdquo; exists between its ADVERTISING MAGIC service mark and my
client&rsquo;s AD MAGIC service mark.</p><hr /><p style="margin: 8px

Reform<br /></strong></p><p style="margin: 8px 0px;"><strong>Thursday,
March 18, 2010</strong></p><p style="margin: 8px 0px;">Trademark issues
for small businesses have becoming increasingly common.  The 2009 dispute
between Monster Energy Drink and Rock Art Brewery over the latter's
&quot;Vermonster&quot; beer is a prime example of this.  While the two
companies eventually reached an agreement over use of their respective
marks, the controversy got the attention of Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy,
whose recently introduced trademark reform bill would require a study of
&quot;whether large corporations are misusing the trademark laws to harass
small businesses by exaggerating the scope of their trademark
protection.&quot;  At the same time, we can't forget that larger
corporations have strong interests and in some cases legal and/or
shareholder obligations to enforce the strength of their mark.</p><p
style="margin: 8px 0px;">The IILP was excited to host Rock Art's attorney,
Douglas K. Riley of Lisman, Webster &amp; Leckerling, PC of Burlington, VT
for a discussion of his IP practice, which includes many clients in
Vermont's burgeoning &quot;artisan foods&quot; industry.  Lauren Mandell,
Senior IP Counsel at Diageo North America, one of the largest alcoholic
beverage brand owners in the world, also joined to discuss her practice. 
Professor Dan Hunter moderated this discussion of the trademark interests
of small and large businesses and how to reform and refine the rules to

Exceptions for the Visually Impaired and Print Disabled: International
Initiatives to Increase Access to Knowledge<br /></strong></p><p
style="margin: 8px 0px;"><strong>Tuesday, March 16, 2010 <br
/></strong></p><p style="margin: 8px 0px;">The visually impaired and print
disabled experience widespread barriers in their efforts to gain access to
knowledge. These barriers include the shortage of books and other
copyrighted works in accessible formats. In 1996, the U.S. Copyright Act
was amended to allow the reproduction and distribution of certain
copyrighted works in specialized formats for exclusive use by the blind or
visually impaired. Although this limitation to the exclusive rights of
copyright owners is a major improvement, it impact is limited to works
protected by U.S. copyright and to U.S. residents.</p><p>The World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has been considering access for
the visually impaired and print disabled in recent years as part of its
work on copyright limitations and exceptions. In early 2009, in connection
with international initiatives, the United States Copyright Office and
other federal agencies launched a domestic consultation process with a
number of stakeholders and the public in order to gather information about
their experiences with the current statutory limitation for the visually
impaired and print disabled.</p><p>Michele Woods, Senior Counsel for
Policy &amp; International Affairs with the U.S. Copyright Office, visited
NYLS and presented a detailed discussion regarding the initiatives taken by
the United States to help close the domestic and international knowledge
gap for the visually impaired and print disabled. The event also
highlighted the role of the many federal agencies that contribute to the
development of the U.S. intellectual property policy.</p><hr /><p

/><h2>Patents and Green Technology</h2><p><strong>Wednesday, March 3, 2010
<br /></strong></p><p>The Institute for Information Law &amp; Policy
invites you to attend a discussion on patents and green technology. The
need to &ldquo;be green&rdquo; is everywhere; from the market to the
media, the technology used to promote environmental efficiency has gained
international popularity. The green movement is main stream, as the public
is inundated with advertisements full of hybrid or energy efficient
products ranging from cars to light bulbs. But like any other new
technology, these inventions also deserve the exclusive rights granted to
inventors under patent law. The new administration has brought attention
to this field by calling for greater developments in the areas of green
energy and other environmental protections. It is evident that the need
for these technologies is worldwide. Will all of this attention lead to an
increase in respective patent applications?</p><p>Carl Horton, Chief IP
Counsel for GE, will be speaking at an event surrounding the recent rise
in interest of green technologies and how they fit in with patent
protection. In the past 12 years Carl has led IP teams in over 10
countries throughout the world in protecting a wide range of products and
services for GE ranging from diagnostic imaging equipment such as MRI, CT,
PET &amp; ultrasound equipment and related contrast agents, to hospital
information technology systems and genomic/proteomic-based products, to
circuit breakers and reliable power transmission systems, switches, drive
systems, motors and a host of high temperature thermoplastic
materials.</p><hr /><p><strong>Liberating Legal Information: The Law.Gov

Arch Wireless has &ldquo;open[ed] a new frontier in Fourth Amendment
jurisprudence that has been little explored.&rdquo; 529 F.3d 892, 904
(2008). The court denied rehearing en banc, and on December 14, 2009, the
Supreme Court granted cert. to resolve three separate Fourth Amendment
questions. The Court did not certify a question on the Stored
Communications Act issue. The case involves a police officer&rsquo;s text
messages on a department-issued pager and a battle between formal and
informal department policies. While some have speculated that the court
may limit its decision to the government employee context, the decision
will likely affect private employers as well. Also, many think that
clarity on the role of the Fourth Amendment and new communications
technology is sorely needed. The third question certified by the Court,
whether third parties have an expectation of privacy in text messages sent
to government employees, raises some interesting issues with respect to
state or federal FOIA and public disclosure laws in addition to the Fourth
Amendment. Join us for a discussion of the case, the Fourth Amendment, the
Stored Communications Act, and the role of third parties in protecting (or

/><div><strong>William Patry discussed his new book, Moral Panics and the
Copyright Wars</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Monday,
November 2, 2009</strong><br />&nbsp;</div><div>Metaphors, moral panics,
folk devils, predictable irrationality, and free market fundamentalism are
just some of the topics William Patry will be discussing, along with his
new book, Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars, at a luncheon event at
NYLS.<br />In Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars, William Patry lays bare
how we got to where we are: a bloated, punitive legal regime that has
strayed far from its modest, but important roots. Patry demonstrates how
copyright is a utilitarian government program--not a property or moral
right. As a government program, copyright must be regulated and held
accountable to ensure it is serving its public purpose.<br
/>&nbsp;</div><div>A centrist and believer in appropriately balanced
copyright laws, Patry concludes that calls for strong copyright laws, just
like calls for weak copyright laws, miss the point entirely: the only laws
we need are effective laws, laws that further the purpose of encouraging
the creation of new works and learning. Our current regime, unfortunately,
creates too many bad incentives, leading to bad conduct. Just as President
Obama has called for re-tooling and re-imagining the auto industry, Patry
calls for a remaking of our copyright laws so that they may once again be
respected.</div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;"

have witnessed an explosion in the field of patent law. New developments
in the law generate a constant need for lawyers with specialized
backgrounds, both in the Patent and Trademark Office and in private and
corporate practice. Even when other markets for the services of lawyers
are affected by recession, the demand for patent attorneys typically
remains high. As long as people invent or create, there is a need for
intellectual property lawyers to protect and enforce intellectual property

letters DVF mean anything to you? Can you distinguish interlocking C's
from interlocking G's? Why do some designers d&eacute;but their work in
Paris and not in New York? Fashion may appear to be all labels and luxury,
but there is a plethora of legal opportunities in fashion and numerous
intellectual property questions in the fashion industry. The Institute for
Information Law &amp; Policy presents Fashionably Law: IP and Industry - an
event series focused on the legal environment of the fashion business, the
legal controversies in fashion, and the way that you can break into the
industry.<br style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Verdana;" /><br
style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Verdana;" />Fashion Law is an emerging
field within Intellectual Property, and the prevalence of cases involving
the fashion industry is no passing trend. Copyright, trademark, and even
patents each play a role in fashion law, but the field is too dynamic to
group in just those labels. Current legislation regarding expanded design
protection may change not just the fashion industry, but Intellectual
Property as whole.&nbsp; On Thursday, September 3rd, 2009, Professor Dan
Hunter gave a lecture explaining exactly what fashion law is, what the
current legal trends within the fashion industry are, and what roles
attorneys play in the business.</p><hr /><p style="padding: 0px; margin:
