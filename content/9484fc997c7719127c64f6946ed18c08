<p>You cant mention casino poker, or even a casino for that matter, without mentioning the free drinks. Of course, even if you dont drink you can still get some free non-alcoholic beverages, so there you go. Where else are these types of things possible? Nowhere, thats where. </p>
<p>The next thing is that usually when youre playing poker at a casino, youre planning on staying over in the casinos hotel that evening. While it really goes without saying that staying over in a such a place is like revisiting Christmas when you were a kid, some people out there have actually not experienced it. Its basically a free ticket to get absolutely plastered and then pass out in a lavish, royally decked out hotel room. If that doesnt sound like fun, then you my friend need to get out more.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best part about playing poker in a casino is that you get to play with some very serious players. While many tourists come in and try their hand at a particular game, for the most part, youre going to be playing with some people who have the same passion to play the game that you do. And that, with all seriousness, is a very cool thing to experience.</p>
<p>If youve never been able to experience the juvenile type fun of playing poker in a casino (or even just going to casino in general) than by all means, please go do it. Its not only a great way to release some stress and have some good old fashioned fun, but it will give you a new love for this game of poker that has been a part of our lives for so very long. It will give you a new respect for the game and a different perspective on how it is played by a different variation of people. Despite what you say, the couch poker games you host at your buddies house are not very serious. Poker in a casino is poker at its purest and most competitive. If you call yourself a fan of the game, than you just have to experience it  theres no way around it.</p>
