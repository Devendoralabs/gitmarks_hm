<h2>Mars: A MapReduce Framework on Graphics Processors</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Mars is a MapReduce framework on 
graphic processors (GPUs). We develop this framework aiming at providing a 
generic framework for developers to implement data- and computation-intensive 
tasks correctly, efficiently, and easily on the GPU. Mars hides the programming 
complexity of the GPU behind the simple and familiar MapReduce interface. 
Therefore, the developers can write their code on the GPU without any knowledge 
of the graphics APIs or the GPU architecture. We have implemented six common 
tasks in web applications and our results indicate that Mars is up to over an 
order of magnitude faster than its CPU-based counterpart for these  
applications on a quad-core machine.

Mars is developed by Bingsheng He 
and Wenbin Fang under the supervision of Naga K. Govindaraju (Microsoft Corp.), 
Qiong Luo (HKUST), and Tuyong Wang (Sina.com).

<ul>
<li>Nov 16, 2009: <a href = "http://www.cse.ust.hk/catalac/users/wenbin/mars/Mars.zip">The latest version</a>.
This version runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit linux, and supports the latest
CUDA SDK 2.3.
It includes 8 applications:
String Match, Matrix Multiplication, Inverted Index, Word Count, Page
View Rank, Page View Count, Similarity Score, and Kmeans.

<li><a href = "Mars_v2.zip">Mars_v2.zip</a>: the second version, including experiment
data from our PACT08 paper and templates for application development. This version runs on Windows. Aug 2008.
	
<li><a href="Mars.zip">Mars.zip</a>( 
	~0.5MB): It includes the implementation of the framework and the six web 
	applications. This version runs on Linux. Nov 25, 2007.
