        <h1>Beej's Python Flickr API has moved</h1>

        <p>Beej's Python Flickr API has moved away from
        SourceForget.net to <a
            href='http://stuvel.eu/projects/flickrapi'>a new home
            at stuvel.eu</a>.</p>

        <p>Updating the pages at sf.net and managing releases was just
        too much of a fuss. Our new home is much more comfortable.</p>
