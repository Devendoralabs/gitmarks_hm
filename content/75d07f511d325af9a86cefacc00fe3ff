Walrus is a tool for interactively visualizing large directed graphs in
three-dimensional space.  By employing a fisheye-like distortion, it
provides a display that simultaneously shows local detail and the global
context.

<h3>Source Code Available</h3>

The source code to Walrus is now available under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>.  You may <a href="#download">download the source code</a> below.
</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  

Walrus is a tool for interactively visualizing large directed graphs in
three-dimensional space.  It is technically possible to display graphs
containing a million nodes or more, but visual clutter, occlusion, and
other factors can diminish the effectiveness of Walrus as the number of
nodes, or the degree of their connectivity, increases.  Thus, in practice,
Walrus is best suited to visualizing moderately sized graphs that are
nearly trees.  A graph with a few hundred thousand nodes and only a
slightly greater number of links is likely to be comfortable to work with.
</p>
<p>
Walrus computes its layout based on a user-supplied spanning tree.  Because
the specifics of the supplied spanning tree greatly affect the resulting
display, it is crucial that the user supply a spanning tree that is both
meaningful for the underlying data and appropriate for the desired insight.
The prominence and orderliness that Walrus gives to the links in the
spanning tree, in contrast to all other links, means that an arbitrarily
chosen spanning tree may create a misleading or ineffective visualization.
Ideally, the input graphs should be inherently hierarchical.
</p>
<p>
Walrus uses 3D hyperbolic geometry to display graphs under a fisheye-like
distortion.  At any moment, the amount of magnification, and thus the level
of visible detail, varies across the display.  This allows the user to
examine the fine details of a small area while always having a view of the
whole graph available as a frame of reference.  Graphs are rendered inside
a sphere that contains the Euclidean projection of 3D hyperbolic space.
Points within the sphere are magnified according to their radial distance
from the center.  Objects near the center are magnified, while those near
the boundary are shrunk.  The amount of magnification decreases
continuously and at an accelerated rate from the center to the boundary,
until objects are reduced to zero size at the latter, which represents
infinity.  By bringing different parts of a graph to the magnified central
region, the user can examine every part of the graph in detail.
</p>
<p>
Walrus is being developed by Young Hyun at CAIDA.  Although Walrus is
based on research by Tamara Munzner, she is not connected with this
effort in any way, nor does Walrus make use of any code from her
H3Viewer.
</p>
<h3>Applicability</h3>
<p>
  

Please note that Walrus currently has the following requirements,
restrictions, or limitations which may render it unsuitable for a given
problem domain or dataset:

    <ul>
<li>
<b>Only directed graphs are supported</b>.</li>
<li>
<b>Only connected graphs with reachable nodes are supported.</b>  All nodes must be reachable from all other nodes if the direction of links is disregarded, and all nodes must be reachable from the root node if the direction of links is enforced.</li>
<li>
<b>A meaningful spanning tree is required.</b>  The spanning tree must be meaningful with respect to the problem domain, dataset, research hypothesis, or in some other way.  It must not be arbitrary.  (This is a crucial requirement.  Difficulty in coming up with such a spanning tree is a sure sign that Walrus is unsuitable for the task.)  Note that this requirement does not preclude cycles or other non-tree links in the graph itself.</li>
<li>
<b>Multiple links are not supported.</b>  There cannot be more than one link connecting together any given pair of nodes.  In particular, undirected graphs cannot be simulated with bidirectional links.</li>
<li>
<b>Dynamically changing graphs are not supported.</b>  It is not possible to alter the structure or content of a graph once loaded or to update the display based on a data feed.</li>
<li>
<b>Only one graph may be loaded at any time.</b>  In particular, two graphs cannot be loaded for side-by-side comparison.</li>
<li>
<b>Slight changes in the structure of a graph may lead to dramatically different graph layouts.</b>  It may be difficult to compare related graphs, such as those representing snapshots of an evolving dataset.</li>
<li>
<b>Only LibSea graph files (a documented CAIDA-developed input format) are supported.</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Walrus is a standalone application and not an API.</b>  It cannot be incorporated into other applications.</li>
<li>
<b>Walrus cannot be used as an applet.</b>
</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>Galleries</h3>
<p>
  

The following galleries show graphs of various sizes and complexity.  Some
are network topology graphs derived from <i><a href="/tools/measurement/skitter/">skitter</a></i>
measurements, with sizes ranging from ten thousand to five hundred thousand
nodes.  Others represent our web site directory hierarchy (around fourteen
thousand nodes), CVS repository (around eighteen thousand nodes), and
directory trees.

<h3>Implemented Features</h3>
<p>
  
    
<ul>
<li>rendering at a guaranteed framerate regardless of graph size</li>
<li>coloring nodes and links with a fixed color, or by RGB values stored in attributes</li>
<li>labelling nodes</li>
<li>picking nodes to examine attribute values</li>
<li>displaying a subset of nodes or links based on a user-supplied
                boolean attribute</li>
<li>interactive pruning of the graph to temporarily reduce
                clutter and occlusion</li>
<li>zooming in and out</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>Features Under Consideration</h3>
<p>
  
    
<ul>
<li>more options for coloring objects (such as with a perceptually uniform colorscale)</li>
<li>filtering and other interactive processing</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
      
Walrus requires
<i><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d/">Java3D</a></i> v1.2.1 (or later) and 
<i><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">JDK</a></i> 1.3.0 (or later).  
A hardware-accelerated graphics card with OpenGL support is required
(<b>on Windows systems, you must use the OpenGL version of Java3D
and not the DirectX version</b>).  It is also necessary to have
a speedy machine with lots of memory (128MB is probably a minimum; 256MB or
more is better; 512MB is probably required for a few hundred thousand nodes).
    </p>
<p>
Walrus was developed and tested on a Sun Ultra 60 with an Elite 3D card
and 512MB of RAM, running Solaris 7, a box graciously donated by Sun.
    </p>

<blockquote>
<span class="bold">Note:</span> 
The current (as of 2005) MacOS X port of Java3D does not work properly with MacOS X 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5 (Leopard).  There are noticeable glitches in the rendering, especially in the animated transition effects of Walrus, and the drawing of node labels does not work at all.  So, until Apple/Sun fixes Java3D, Walrus is unusable under MacOS X 10.4 and 10.5 (although it should still work with older MacOS X releases).

<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>
      

The latest version is 0.6.3, released on Mar 30, 2005.  This is the first public release of the source code.
    </p>
<p>
Changes since 0.6.2, released Feb 20, 2003:

    <ul>
<li>No changes to any functionality; just a licensing change to the GPL.</li>
<li>Added 'palmtree.graph' to set of sample graphs.</li>
</ul>
    
</p>
<p>
Changes since 0.6.1, released Nov 4, 2002:

    <ul>
<li>No new features.</li>
<li>Corrected equation for computing colors in guide.txt.</li>
</ul>
    
</p>
<p>
Changes since 0.6, released Apr 29, 2002:

    <ul>
<li>No new features.</li>
<li>Re-implemented routines for hyperbolic transformations.</li>
</ul>
    
</p>
<p>
Changes since 0.5, released Apr 19, 2002:

    <ul>
<li>
         Added support for zooming the display.
         The user can zoom in toward the central node or zoom out from it
         to an arbitrary degree.
      </li>
<li>
         Added support for turning depth cueing off.
      </li>
<li>
         Fixed bug in which picking would sometimes become temporarily 
         inaccurate after the window is resized.
      </li>
<li>
         Fixed bug in which the display would lock up if the user executed
         a command through the keyboard while concurrently interacting with
         the mouse.
      </li>
</ul>
    
</p>
<p>
Changes since 0.4, released Apr 12, 2002:

    <ul>
<li>
         Added support for temporarily hiding parts of the graph.
         For example, the user can display only the subtree rooted at the
         current central node.  It should now be much easier to navigate
         and examine large complicated graphs, since occlusion can be
         eliminated by selective pruning.
      </li>
<li>
         Added code to detect and warn about malformed spanning trees.
      </li>
<li>
         Added support for quickly navigating to the parent of the current
         central node.
      </li>
<li>
         Added support for resetting the rendering state.
         Loss of floating-point precision can cause the display to become
         wholly useless.  This sometimes happens while navigating very large
         graphs.
      </li>
</ul>
    
</p>
<p>
Changes since 0.3, released Apr 1, 2002:

    <ul>
<li>
         Added support for computing the layout using extended precision
         arithmetic (about 30 decimal digits of precision).
         Previously, the layout calculations would sometimes yield invalid
         coordinates (NaNs) for some tall and bushy graphs.  This problem
         went unnoticed because Java does not throw floating-point exceptions.
      </li>
</ul>
    
</p>
<p>
Changes since 0.2, released on Jan 25, 2002:

    <ul>
<li>
        Added some more introductory documentation on the LibSea
        file format.  This should help people to get up to speed
        quickly. See docs/guide.txt.
     </li>
<li>
        Added support for overlaid node labels.  Attribute values
        can now be shown in the display area next to the relavant
        nodes.  These labels, however, are only temporary and
        disappear once the user moves or refreshes the window.
     </li>
<li>
        Added support for selection attributes.  A boolean attribute
        in the graph file can be used to specify which nodes or links
        are to be displayed.
     </li>
<li>
        Added support for displaying attributes of list type.
        Previously, only scalar attributes could be displayed.
     </li>
<li>
        Improved the layout of binary trees.  Walrus now makes better
        use of available space when laying out binary trees.
     </li>
<li>
        Fixed bug in which links would sometimes be drawn as black lines.
        If you had transparency enabled and then switched the coloring of
        links to RGB (that is, to colors stored in an attribute), then
        links would sometimes be drawn incorrectly as black lines.
     </li>
<li>
        Fixed bug in which rotations would stop working when axes were
        disabled while running the nonadaptive render loop.
     </li>
</ul>
    
</p>
<p>
Changes since 0.1, released on Dec 5, 2001:

    <ul>
<li>Re-implemented the picking algorithm.
          Picking is now more accurate and intuitive in behavior.</li>
<li>Added full support for color to the nonadaptive render loop.
          The nonadaptive render loop is active when Rendering-&gt;Adaptive
          Rendering is unchecked.</li>
<li>Fixed a refresh bug.
          The display would sometimes fail to refresh when the user clicked
          within the Walrus window to bring it to the front.</li>

<a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~munzner/">Tamara Munzner</a> worked out many of the ideas and techniques underlying
Walrus in her

Another related work is the hyperbolic tree viewer at
<a href="http://www.inxight.com">Inxight</a>. Walrus
differs from their product in at least three ways. We work in 3D instead of
2D, use the
<a href="http://www.geom.umn.edu/docs/forum/hype/model.html">Klein model</a> of hyperbolic geometry instead of the Poincare, and use a
very different layout algorithm.  Laying out graphs in 3D is challenging,
as occlusion along the line of sight diminishes some of the benefits of the
additional dimension.  Hence, 3D layout algorithms can differ considerably
from similar 2D algorithms.  Walrus uses a modified version of the H3 layout
algorithm designed by Munzner.
