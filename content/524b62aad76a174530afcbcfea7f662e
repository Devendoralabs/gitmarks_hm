				<h2><a href="http://www.wisdump.com/web/the-ebb-and-flow-of-social-networking/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The Ebb and Flow of Social Networking">The Ebb and Flow of Social Networking</a></h2>
				<p>I joined Facebook today. I resisted as long as I could.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but notice a recent surge of other people I know signing up recently as well &#8211; nor could I shake off the odd sense of déjà vu. It seems like such a short time ago that MySpace was the place to be in terms of social networking &#8211; now it seems that&#8217;s all over and Facebook is now the <em>&#8216;site du jour&#8217;</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time something like this has happened, either &#8211; there have been countless communities online that have grown, peaked, and slowly faded into obscurity. Like a roving band of wildebeest, it seems communities arrive en masse, graze for a while, and move on to pastures anew.</p>
<p>The current crop of Web 2.0 sites seem to have amplified this trend &#8211; there are more and more sites cropping up with a community angle, so now people hungry for social interaction on the web have a near boundless choice for their communal appetites.</p>
<p>As surely as Facebook has risen to challenge MySpace, and as Digg has all but displaced Slashdot, in the not-too distant future there will be other sites which rise to threaten the current generation. Perhaps the MySpace killer is already out there, just waiting for a chance to break the mainstream?</p>
<h3>Modelling Social Network Communities Growth</h3>
<p><img src="http://wisdump.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/the-ebb-and-flow-of-social-networking.png" alt="Ebb &amp; Flow Diagram" title="Ebb &amp; Flow Diagram" align="left" /> The early days of a community site are its most fragile -most start-ups will fail without ever making it past this phase. Those familiar with running forums or sites with a community aspect will know how hard it is to get a sustained level of activity without a solid user base &#8211; avoiding the tumbleweed can be difficult.</p>
<p>With work and persistence some sites will begin to make headway &#8211; a small, closely-knit community can develop. Many community sites will persist at this level, with no real reason to change &#8211; others may get lucky and find a break &#8211; whether it&#8217;s a link from a major blog (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> or similar), getting on the front page of <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> (or <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</a>, etc), or even a news report or feature in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Such buzz can cause a massive spike in traffic &#8211; propelling the previously unheard-of site into the view of thousands more people, and potentially kick-starting a chain reaction large enough to push into the mainstream. Of course, there are no guarantees &#8211; a spike in interest from a single link can come and go very quickly, with little net benefit.</p>
<p>The social networking site <a href="http://www.virb.com">Virb</a> has had its fair share of buzz &#8211; it&#8217;s <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/Virb_Myspace_done_right_out_of_beta">been on Digg</a>, been featured on a few <a href="http://mashable.com/2006/12/27/virb/">high-profile blogs</a>, but has a fairly modest Alexa ranking of around 5,000 (at the time of writing). It&#8217;s firmly in the &#8216;crunch&#8217; phase of start-up sites &#8211; the &#8216;<strong>Valley of Uncertainty</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p>For Virb, there are two possible paths &#8211; the first is unfettered and gradually accelerating growth, the other is to remain in the doldrums indefinitely. With such a great deal of competition in the social networking sphere, it could go either way.</p>
<p>Facebook is the perfect example for a site currently in the midst of meteoric growth &#8211; from an Alexa ranking of around <strong>50,000 in 2005</strong> to around <strong>100 in 2006</strong>, to <strong>18 today in 2007</strong>. Little wonder that people are eager to acquire the site &#8211; <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/">even at a stupidly high price</a>.</p>
<p>Such rapid growth is unsustainable, of course &#8211; and ultimately such popularity will reach a peak. There are but a finite number of people to populate any given social network, and humans are notably fickle creatures. Ultimately the usage levels for any given site will stabilise &#8211; social networking site <a href="http://www.bebo.com">Bebo</a> and social news site <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> are both in neutral-growth periods &#8211; not to say that future growth is impossible, but without intervention the user base is unlikely to <em>spontaneously</em> increase.</p>
<p>For the top few sites that attain popular appeal, a healthy period of traffic and utilisation follows the peak in usage &#8211; established services such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> and <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> have such sustained appeal that they persist at a relatively stable level &#8211; the &#8216;<strong>Plateau of Ubiquity</strong>&#8216;, if you please. How long a site persists here depends on several factors, principally including the fierceness of competition and the rate at which a site can evolve to keep its users happy.</p>
<p>The internet is a fast changing place, and to hold a position of dominance with so many fresh upstarts is not easy. While a community site can revitalise, innovate and hence prompt additional growth, life at the top is tough. For many once-reigning sites a slow yet inexorable decline is inevitable. The once mighty <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> is still very popular &#8211; it&#8217;s in the Alexa Top 500 &#8211; but slipping further and further away from the pole position it once held, with younger upstart Digg usurping its audience.</p>
<p>Social networking and community-led sites dominate the top ranked sites on Alexa, second only to the search engine contingent. With such massive reach and the potential for direct marketing, it&#8217;s not in the least surprising that the top of such sites are seeing such lucrative buyouts &#8211; $580m for MySpace, $1.65b for YouTube, and a touted $1b for Facebook. I don&#8217;t doubt that some of these acquisitions are worth it &#8211; the potential to reach people directly on the sites where they spend most of their time is valuable indeed.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll see you all on Facebook. For now, at least.</p>

			<p>I think you have a point here, but is it really that different from any other industry? The &#8220;product lifte-cycle&#8221; is studied in most marketing/management courses &#8212; it ends with a maturity stage, then decline/death. Entire industries often have a similar lifecycle (think VCRs, or even stage coaches).</p>

			<p>Mike &#8211; Very true, but what&#8217;s remarkable is just how quickly such networks come and go. There&#8217;s been several generations of online communities &amp; social sites in the last 10 years &#8211; ranging from archaic BBS networks, through Usenet, forums, and the current batch of socially-led sites.</p>
<p>Even with technologies such as VHS / DVD / HD-DVD you&#8217;ve got a product lifecycle of years, possibly decades &#8211; compare this to the short years and months of a popular online community.</p>

			<p>To further illustrate your point, where&#8217;s Friendster? or Second Life?</p>
<p>Some of the cycle is accelerated by press coverage. You get an artificial spike of signups and attention, everyone creates an account, and after two weeks, three-quarters of them don&#8217;t come back. </p>
<p>But the real issue is that sites that focus on young users looking for the next trend are mostly bound to be abandoned at  the same pace. You joined Facebook in a swell along with your friends; you&#8217;ll all move onto the next club in 6 months (or 12, or 3) when something more up to date comes along.</p>

			<p>A cursory glance at the Alexa data for Friendster (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.friendster.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.friendster.com</a>) would indicate it&#8217;s approaching, or has just reached, a peak. </p>
<p>Second Life is a little more difficult to gauge, but the traffic seems relatively steady, which could indicate either a plateau in usage or a slow but healthy increase.</p>
<p>I do hope Facebook sticks around for a while &#8211; I&#8217;m getting sick of registering for sites like these! :-)</p>

			<p>What would really be interesting to see if possible is where the people go when leaving a site. Another interesting thing to notice is how sites react to each phase they are in. It seems Digg is aware of the stagnation/decline and because of this announced they will do product reviews, which I&#8217;m not too sure will work well with their community. Sometimes you are so locked in with what you do there is no way out.</p>
<p>Of course if you are Myspace/Bebo/Facebook and have millions of users it is hard to always expect an upward climb as there are only so many people on the web and only so many that care about sites such as those.</p>

			<p>One of our cast members started a group at Facebook about a week and a half ago. At first I was hesitant to sign up myself, but within a few days Facebook was sending us 100+ visitors a day. I had to see what it was all about.</p>
<p>As it turns out the Globe Roamer TV group has just under 300 members and it has only been a week since it was launched. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious Facebook is becoming more and more active. More so than I think most of us realize.</p>

			<p>Interesting to see that Second Life is mentioned in the comments but not on the main article; in fact, although the website for <a href="http://secondlife.com" rel="nofollow">http://secondlife.com</a> does not have anything to do with the actual usage of the platform (since it is <i>not</i> web-based and thus escapes Alexa&#8217;s ranking), the site supporting the creation of a Second Life account has been steadily hovering around #1500 for at least half a year now. Even if tt doesn&#8217;t directly reflect actual usage of Second Life; nevertheless, it&#8217;s still interesting to reckon as at least a 6-month-long plateaux. If it&#8217;s on the &#8220;Uncertainty Valley&#8221; or the &#8220;ubiquous&#8221; stage, it&#8217;s hard to know; the visionaries and optimists would certainly claim it&#8217;s still on the valley yet&#8230;</p>
<p>So, and what happened to Ringo, Friendster, Orkut (the latter is still #8 on Alexa&#8230;)?</p>

			<p>The article makes a good observation but I feel it should have went further. This is interesting for any startup as understanding how your business will grow and develop is critical to any success.</p>
<p>As has been pointed out Digg seems to be the obvious one that have realised there is this trend and are trying to do something about it, by essentially adding in more features which would hopefully get them another spike in new users.</p>
<p>Too many sites assume because they were succesful once, and have 500,000 visitors they will continue with that traffic. People are too fickle for that and if content and features arn&#8217;t being added people will slowly stop returning.</p>

			<p>social sites depend on dynamic periodic updates to remain &#8216;fresh&#8217; to the user. people get sick of the same site, so they try new ones&#8230; like I am getting sick of myspace, so I am trying facebook out. without frequent overhauls of the look and feel of a site, it is bound to level off in user base and will eventually decline as competitor sites develop strategies to compete.</p>

			<p>the problem is finding away to make your site sticky. face has features that will bring you back everyday but will that be enough. something nobody every talks about is the voyeurism factor. everytime a social networking site allows people to see who looks at their profile they combust. that was the final nail in friendster&#8217;s coffin. </p>

			<p>Suggesting that SlashDot is on the decline is absurd.  Particularly, the suggestion that Digg of all sites has replaced ShashDot.  The readers of SlashDot are second to none in terms of collective knowledge and the forums of SlashDot are far richer, better written, and contain more knowledge than Digg.  </p>
<p>Secondly quantity is not necessarily better than quality.  Slashdot chooses a good set of articles and does not try to inundate users with sites, which is the allure Digg.</p>

			<p>[...] A nice post on Social Networking sites over here at wisdump, it does however make some assumptions that largely the same groups of users float from one networking site to the next leaving the others behind for dead. This may be true in some cases, but it doesn&#8217;t take account of the increasingly large number of broadband connected always on users and the increasing uptake of web communication as the de facto way of keeping in touch. True there are a finite number of users, so super rapid growth can&#8217;t be sustained in the long term, however this doesnt also equate to an equally speedy up and leave mentality. I think we&#8217;re still way way off the peak of adoption in social networking sites, and there are countless scores more to emerge and challenge for a place among the frontrunners. [...]</p>

			<p>The figures of all these &#8216;social networking&#8217; sites are hugely overblown (aside: if people spend so much time on these sites that they neglect their real friends and family are they not _anti-social_ sites?).<br />
I&#8217;m not suggesting they are lying, just that there is a period of buzz during which people visit the site, find something they wish to see (no matter how transitory that interest might be) and have to sign up to get at it. Hey! Another convert joined in! This is particularly prevalent in the earlier stages where the number of potential mugs, sorry &#8211; believers, is greater than the volume of people who have been there, done that, never again.<br />
I am bored with the number of permutations of my name and numbers I have to try in order to sign up  to Yahoo or any other such site &#8211; all the other versions are probably mine too but I can no longer remember the password I made up on the spot to see something on a whim, nor the fake birthday I used as part of my security question (why would I want to use my real one?). Of course I could use the same password I always use (&#8220;chocolate&#8221;, for anyone that cares) but I&#8217;m not Tracy in Marketing so I tend not to be that casual with my security. So, I have contributed between 3 and 5 members to several sites just to see Flickr photos of my friends&#8217; weddings or MySpace pictures posted by someone who at least seems to have enough taste not to have a gaudily coloured, repeated background picture which strains my eyes and brain in equal measure.<br />
No wonder they claim millions of members &#8211; but I wonder how many return visits they get per member&#8230;</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m not convinced this is universally true &#8211; I think it is true in a niche.  We need to draw a distinction between social networking sites, professional networking sites and platforms (such as second life). The demographics and behaviours of each are very different.  </p>
<p>I refer you to a survey I did recently:</p>

			<p>Great post.  What I&#8217;d like to research a bit more is what the impact of hitting the plateau at a lower usage level is.  In other words, is there a drawback to creating a major frenzy and having no place to go but down? (becoming flash in the pan) Perhaps there&#8217;s more to learn from the social networks that don&#8217;t reach the huge critical mass, but instead settle in among a more focused and sustainable constituency.</p>

<p>Not that I&#8217;ve signed up to many social networking communities, I&#8217;ve deliberately been selective, partly because there are only so many hours in the day to check/update my entry/profile, but partly because you have to consider the value of each network. </p>

<p>Btw, there&#8217;s a byline at the bottom of the post. With the coming redesign I imagine it may be more integrated.</p>

			<p>Hey man.  I noticed your site and I&#8217;ve been thinking the same paranoid thoughts.  In fact, I started a facebook group dedicated to it.  It&#8217;s called Facial Deconstruction (South African network)</p>
<p>The idea is to get a bunch of university philosophy and theory students together to discuss how and why things like facebook and myspace happen.  To deconstruct facebook from within itself.  So far, response has been slow.  It turns out that no matter how intelligent people are, their brains switch off when they go on Facebook.  Even I haven&#8217;t managed to post anything useful.  I would appreciate it if anyone just went and had a look.  </p>
<p>I thought it might be an interesting project.  My idea was to gather a whole lot of relevant posts, sift out the rubbish, edit it and possibly publish it as an ebook.  No real profits or anything, just an interesting thing to do.<br />
Leave a message on the group wall if you would like to join.</p>

			<p>Mike, yes this is very true. But an interesting point to make is how can a social networking site stay popular. Surely if the website was to continuously evolve, improve and extend itself it would not fade out into obscurity. Alternatively, one could take the Google approach and just buy the competition.</p>

			<p>[...] Perhaps it&#8217;s because online communities are perceived as rather ephemeral (think of the exoduses from Friendster to Myspace to Facebook [great article on that subject here]) that journalists and academics have steered clear of historical approaches to them. This would of course be the classic act of mistaking the medium for the content, because as anybody who participates in any of those social networking sites mentioned above knows, you tend to stick with many of the same people regardless of the site you&#8217;re on. Obviously, there are many fly-by-night guilds, and one-man guilds around, but many guilds have long and fascinating histories. [...]</p>

			<p>Stuart Brown&#8217;s diagram is a direct ripoff of Gartner&#8217;s &#8220;hype cycle.&#8221; This has been in use since about 1998, and used to evaluate the maturity of emerging technologies. Gartner has five stages: technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. That he doesn&#8217;t attribute them for the inspiration is pretty poor. Ho hum. Also, one thing that rather pisses me off is the reliance on Alexa to determine how popular site are. Really &#8211; this is just bunk. Alexa&#8217;s rankings are based on data derived from myopic geeks running the Alexa toolbar in their browsers. They&#8217;re a sub-set of a subset of population. Basing any kind of judgement on what&#8217;s actually popular against those sorts of stats is just idiotic.</p>

			<p>I think all of your points are valid and reasonable, however there is another dynamic that was overlooked.<br />
These social networking sites usually end up dominated by a certain sect, denomination or age range which will eventually alienate all but the most hardcore user. Then it&#8217;s time to move on. The original core group at Facebook has all but disappeared including me because the focus has shifted. Eventually the new hot thing will come along and I&#8217;ll jump in until it gets polluted then I&#8217;m gone.</p>

			<p>I feel sorry for people who havent got the strength of mind to create a web presence for themselves without using all these community sites. Its just a herd instinct, and the graph shown in the article doesn&#8217;t surprise me in the slightest. People are so fickle, they jump from one bandwagon to another because they&#8217;re afraid of missing out on something. Often a trait of the younger set, which is where I don&#8217;t belong these days.<br />
I suppose, if their offline lives are so boring, then they need an Internet social networking community to give them a sense of identity. To my mind its just a big gossip circle. There are business opportunities to be had with it, if you work with it effectively, but the constant rise and fall to/from stardom makes it rather unreliable.<br />
