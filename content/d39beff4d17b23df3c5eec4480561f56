<p><strong>FeedWordPress</strong> is an <a href="/wiki/license">open-source</a> Atom/RSS aggregator for the WordPress weblog software. You set up feeds that you choose, and FeedWordPress syndicates posts from those sources into your WordPress posts table, where they can be displayed by your <a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/freelinking/Templates" title="reference on WordPress templates" target="_self">WordPress templates</a> like any other post -- but with additional meta-data about the source of each syndicated post, so that your templates can properly attribute the post to its source.</p>

<p>FeedWordPress was originally developed because I needed a more flexible replacement for <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet</a> to use at <a href="http://feministblogs.org/">Feminist Blogs</a>. You can use FeedWordPress to create aggregator (<q>Planet</q>) sites that bring together posts from many different sources, using the WordPress templating engine to display posts from all around the web. Or you can use it to bring together all your online activity from your blog, <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, or other online services, into a <q>Lifestream</q> with all your online activity in one place.</p>

<p>FeedWordPress is designed with flexibility, ease of use, and ease of configuration in mind. You'll need a working installation of WordPress or WordPress MU (version <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0">3.0</a> or later), and also FTP or SFTP access to your web host. You <em>don't</em> need to tweak any plain-text configuration files and you <em>don't</em> need access to shell or crontab on your web host to make it work. (Although, I should mention, web hosts that <em>don't</em> offer shell access and cron jobs are <em>bad web hosts</em>.)</p><!-- <rdf:RDF xmlns="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">

</ul></div>

    <div class="content"><p><strong>Note.</strong> <em>As with the previous release, before you download or install, please note that this version of FeedWordPress <strong>requires WordPress 3</strong> or higher to operate correctly. Do not install the upgrade unless or until you have made the upgrade to WP3.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/feedwordpress.2010.0905.zip">FeedWordPress 2010.0905 is now available for download.</a></p>

<p>I've pushed out this release quickly because it contains fixes to an important issue that y'all helped me discover in early user reports back about <a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/blogs/radgeek/2010/09/03/feedwordpress-20100903-bug-fixes-interface-improvements-lower-memory-load-b">FeedWordPress 2010.0903</a>. As I mentioned in the release notes, the new release of FeedWordPress has some extensive internal changes to allow for a great deal more flexibility in how it handles Categories and Tags (up to and including support for custom taxonomies provided by plugins). Unfortunately, the changes introduced a bug, due to the fact that the new method used to insert Categories and Tags in WordPress 3 screens the terms to be inserted by the current logged-in user's capabilities. Which is fine for normal operations within the WordPress administrative interface; but since automatic updates and updates from FeedWordPress cron jobs are typically carried out <em>without</em> any user logged in whose credentials could be checked, this meant that several users noticed posts being inserted with only the category Uncategorized, and with no Tags. Which presents a problem.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the problem has been fixed in today's quick upgrade:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>BUGFIX: CATEGORIES AND TAGS CORRECTLY ASSIGNED IN AUTOMATIC UPDATES.</strong>
Version 2010.0903 switched over to a new way of assigning categories and
tags as part of its support for handling custom taxonomies.
Unfortunately, the method that it uses is subjected to some checks of
the current user's capabilities, which creates problems for posts that
are being inserted into the WordPress database when there <em>is</em> no
current user logged in (as, for example, when an update is being carried
out from a cron job or automatic update). The result was that posts
from cron jobs and automatic updates ended up with no Categories and no
Tags being assigned. This bug has now been fixed: in 2010.0905, Tags and
Categories should be correctly assigned to all posts, regardless of
whether they were added from manual updates, cron jobs, or automatic
updates.</li>
</ul>

<p>All you need to do to apply the fix is download the newest release and drop it into place in your WordPress plugins directory. As always, if you have any issues with the release, or any questions I can help answer, or if there is anything that you would like to see included in a future release, please use the comments form or <a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/contact">drop me a line</a> to let me know about it. If you have an issue to report, please be sure to tell me what version of FeedWordPress you're using, what version of WordPress you're using it with, which web browser you are using to view the FeedWordPress user interface, and try to tell me, as clearly as possible, (1) what you were trying to do, (2) what the circumstances were, (3) what you expected to see, and (4) what you ended up seeing instead.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am happy to announce that <a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/feedwordpress.2010.0903.zip">FeedWordPress 2010.0903 is now available for download.</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Now stop just a minute.</strong> Before you proceed, be advised: FeedWordPress 2010.0903 has been thoroughly tested for compatibility with WordPress 3.0. It also <strong>requires</strong> WordPress 3.0. If you do not have WordPress 3.0 installed, and aren't yet ready to make the upgrade, you <em>should not</em> attempt to upgrade to this version of FeedWordPress, until you <em>are</em> ready to make the upgrade to WP3.</p>

<p>This release includes a big passle of improvements, fixes, and new features. Some of them have been a long time coming; others are new and fancy. For the fixes, you may be most interested in a fix which apparently solves a really vexing vanishing act that Syndicated Sources performed for some users on various versions of Internet Explorer -- where a big chunk of the user interface would suddenly disappear as soon as you added your first feed. You may also notice some of the new features, like <strong>subscribing to multiple feeds</strong> or the reductions in memory consumption. Many of the best changes, though you may not even notice -- a great deal of the improvements are in low-level interface work, and if I've done my job right it will make your life a few minutes more pleasant every day, without you hardly even noticing it. Many of them are improvements under the hood, which are mainly intended for uber-geeks, hotrodders, or -- and here is where it matters for the rest of you -- <a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/wiki/add-ons-and-filters">Add-On and Filter Developers</a>, who will have that much more of a chance to enrich the FeedWordPress ecosystem. But there's also plenty that should be right out on the surface, for anyone to see, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of some of the major changes since the previous release:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>WORDPRESS 3 REQUIRED:</strong> Please note that this release of FeedWordPress
<em>requires</em> WordPress 3.0 or later. If you are currently using a 2.x
branch of WordPress, you will need to upgrade to WordPress 3 before you
can successfully upgrade FeedWordPress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BUGFIX: NO MORE DISAPPEARING "SYNDICATED SOURCES" PANEL; INTERNET
EXPLORER UI GLITCH APPARENTLY FIXED:</strong> Several users independently
reported a problem with FWP 2010.0623 and various versions of IE. A
problem with the HTML markup caused IE (but not Firefox or
Chrome) to completely hide the Syndicated Sources administration panel
(the main list of currently-syndicated sources, and the main location
for adding new sources, under the Syndication menu item) when a user
added their first syndicated feed. Maddeningly, the glitch seemed to
affect some IE users and not others: I was never able to reproduce the
problem for myself on my own machines. However, the markup of Syndicated
Sources has undergone significant changes and corrections since
2010.0623, and two independent sources who had been having this problem
confirm that they no longer encounter it with the updated version. For
the time being, I am going to declare this bug squashed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BUGFIX: MORE PROTECTION AGAINST FATAL ERRORS FROM PLUGGABLE VERSIONS OF
SimplePie:</strong> FeedWordPress now takes some precautions that should help to
better avoid conflicts for users who have installed pluggable versions
of SimplePie for another plugin or theme. (You may not know that you have
done this; but if you've been encountering fatal errors indicating that
you cannot redeclare class SimplePie, or something along those lines,
there is now a better chance that those fatal errors will be eliminated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PERFORMANCE: SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MEMORY CONSUMPTION FOR LARGE UPDATES:</strong>
FeedWordPress is still a memory-hungry little module, especially when
you are dealing with very large feeds. However, users should notice a
significant reduction in memory overloads, especially if they update a
large number of feeds at once.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>USER INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS:</strong> Nothing is radically different, but there's
been a fair amount of extra spit and polish added, including a convenient
new Dashboard widget that may save you a trip to the Syndication menu,
a lot of effort to make the relationship between global and feed-by-feed
settings more obvious to the user and more easily controllable, to make
navigation between settings pages easier, to sand off a few rough edges,
and to make other improvements on the margins. I hope you'll like how
it looks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ADDING MULTIPLE FEEDS:</strong> FeedWordPress now provides a convenient mode for
adding multiple feeds at once, using either a copy-and-pasted list, or
else an OPML file. Go to Syndication --&gt; Syndicated Sources and check
out the two new buttons underneath the New Source input box. When you
have to add a number of feeds at once, this can save you considerable 
time and trouble.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IMPROVED HANDLING OF AUTHORS WITH DUPLICATE E-MAIL ADDRESS AND AUTHORS
WITH NAMES WRITTEN IN FOREIGN SCRIPTS:</strong> WordPress 3 is increasingly picky
about what it will accept for new author accounts, and some of the
conditions it imposes can cause error conditions that prevent posts from
being properly syndicated, or properly attributed, if authors happen to
have identical e-mail addresses, or if users are given usernames that are
written in non-Western scripts. FeedWordPress now handles these much
better, and systematically works to avoid clashes between syndicated
authors' account names or in their e-mail addresses, which should result
in significantly better results in mapping author names to WordPress
user accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MAPPING CATEGORIES ON SYNDICATED POSTS TO TAGS NOW BETTER SUPPORTED:</strong>
In previous versions, the only way for the Categories provided by a
syndicated feed to be mapped into Post Tags was to instruct FWP to
create new tags, rather than new categories, for unfamiliar categories
from the feed. This works fine if you want tags to be the default; but
if you want only a <em>specific</em> set of tags, there was no way to get them
without getting most or all other categories imported as tags.  You can
now do this by creating a tag (under Posts ==&gt; Post Tags) before
importing the post; when the syndicated category matches a pre-existing
tag, the incoming post will be tagged with that tag, without creating
a local Post Category.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>REL-TAG MICROFORMAT SUPPORT FOR INLINE TAGS:</strong> Syndicated posts that
contain inline tags, marked up using the Rel-Tag microformat
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag">http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag</a>, are now tagged with the tags
provided by Rel-Tag format links.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MUCH GREATER CONTROL OVER CATEGORY AND TAG MAPPING:</strong> This is partly the
result of building in support for a potentially endless set of custom
taxonomies (see below), but in general there has been a great deal of
effort towards giving you more control over how categories and tags
provided by the feed are mapped into terms on the local blog. In
particular, you can now force FeedWordPress to create only categories
from categories and tags provided by the feed; or to create only tags;
or to search both categories and tags for a match; or you can simply
force it to drop all of the categories provided by the feed and use
only categories or tags that you explicitly provide. In addition, you
can now also choose whether to override global categories settings with
a local, feed-specific setting; or whether to <em>add together</em> <em>both</em> the
global categories and the local feed-specific categories -- depending
on whatever your use-case may demand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CUSTOM POST TYPES AND TAXONOMY SUPPORTS:</strong> This is mainly for the
super-geeky, but if you use other plugins or themes that make
significant use of WordPress's support for custom post types and custom
taxonomies, you may be pleased to find that FeedWordPress now allows you
to feed incoming posts into any custom feed type that you wish, and to
map categories and tags from the feed to custom taxonomies as well as
to the standard Category and Tag taxonomies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>STORING NAMESPACED CUSTOM FEED ELEMENTS IN POST CUSTOM FIELDS:</strong> If you
would like to use FeedWordPress's support for storing custom meta-data
from feed elements in the custom fields for a post (for example, to
store geolocation data or iTunes media meta-data), you'll find that it's
now much easier for you to access these namespaced elements. You always
could access them, but in previous versions you might have to write
something ugly like <code>$(/{http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#}lat)</code>
just to get at the value of a <code>&lt;geo:lat&gt;</code> tag. Now, as long as you use
the same mnemonic codes that the feed producer used, you should always
be able to write a nice, simple expression like <code>$(/geo:lat)</code> to get the
value of a <code>&lt;geo:lat&gt;</code> tag. Huzzah!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CUSTOM DIRECTORY STRUCTURE SUPPORT:</strong> if you poke at it enough, WordPress
is relatively flexible about where it should store admin interface code,
uploaded content, plugins, and a number of other things that occupy an
important place in the WordPress directory structure. Previous versions
of FeedWordPress encountered serious errors or broke entirely when used
with directory structures other than the default. This should now be
fixed: FWP now supports custom directory structures wherever    WordPress
allows them to be customized, rather than depending on the default
locations. Enjoy your freedom!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MANY NEW FILTERS AND API UTILITY FUNCTIONS FOR ADD-ON PROGRAMMERS:</strong> There
have been too many improvements to list them all in this ChangeLog, but
it means that much more power and ease for folks who are customizing
FeedWordPress through PHP filters or add-on modules. Fuller
documentation will be put up at the Wiki at feedwordpress.radgeek.org
soon.</p></li>

<p>This release addresses some performance issues related to a bug fix that was introduced in FeedWordPress 2010.0528; it also includes fixes to a couple of issues introduced by the transition to SimplePie (related to a frequent error condition in feed updates) and WordPress 3.0 (related to the author mapping interface in Syndication --&gt; Authors). In addition, some users related an odd fatal error related to the <strong><code>Relative_URI</code></strong> class. I am not sure what was causing this error, but whatever it was, it should no longer be a problem, because this release eliminates the dependency on the <code>Relative_URI</code> class to resolve relative URIs (instead, FeedWordPress now uses a perfectly adequate substitute which is built in to the SimplePie module).</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of some of the major changes since the previous release:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>WORDPRESS 3.0 COMPATIBILITY / AUTHOR MAPPING INTERFACE ISSUES:</strong> I
resolved a couple of outstanding issues with the author mapping
interface (Syndication --&gt; Authors), which were preventing new users
from being created correctly and author mapping rules from being set up
correctly. These partly had to do with new restrictions on user account
creation introduced in WordPress 3.0; anyway, they should now be fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MORE EFFICIENT SYNDICATED URL LOOKUPS:</strong> Several users noticed that the
bug fix introduced in 2010.0528 for compatibility with post-listing
plugins caused a lot more queries to the database in order to look up
numerical post IDs from the URL provided to the filter. This shouldn't
cause any major problems, but it is not as efficient as it could be; the
code now takes advantage of a more efficient way of doing things,
which usually will not require any additional database queries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SIMPLEPIE FEED UPDATE ISSUES:</strong> If you have been having significant
problems with getting feeds to update correctly, this may be the result
of some bugs in the implementation of SimplePie caching that ships with
WordPress (as of version 3.0). (You would most commonly experience this
error if you continually saw errors such as "No feed found at &lt;...&gt;" in
your updates.) Fortunately, SimplePie allows for a great deal of
extensibility and this allows me to work around the problem; these
error conditions should now be mostly eliminated when the underlying
feed is valid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UI: SHOW INACTIVE SOURCES:</strong> When you use the default unsubscribe option
-- which turns off the subscription to a feed while preserving the posts
from it and the syndication-related meta-data for the feed -- the
unsubscribed feed can now easily be viewed in a special "Inactive"
section of the Syndicated Sources page. (As a side benefit, if you've
accidentally, or only temporarily, turned off the subscription to a
feed, it is now much easier to restore the feed to being active, or to
delete it permanently, if you prefer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UI: FEED FINDER / SWITCH FEED INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS:</strong> changes to styling
and options for the feed finder / switch feed, which should now make it
easier, in some cases, to find alternative feeds, and make interface
options more clearly visible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FILTERS: <code>syndicated_item_published</code> and <code>syndicated_item_updated</code> NOW
PROPERLY AFFECT THE DATING OF POSTS.</strong> These filters used to affect some
date-related settings, but not others -- and, most importantly, not the
final date that is set for a post's publication or last-modified date
in the WordPress database. Now, they do affect that, as they should.
(Filters should receive, and return, a long integer, representing a Unix
epoch relative timestamp.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MAGIC URL TO CLEAR THE CACHE:</strong> Suppose that you need to clear the feed
cache, for whatever reason; suppose, even, that you need to clear it on
a regular basis. One way you might do this is by logging into the
FeedWordPress administrative interface and going to Syndication --&gt;
Performance. Another way you might do it, now, is to simply send an
HTTP request to a magic URL provided by FeedWordPress: if your blog is
at example.com, the URL would be <a href="http://example.com/?clear_cache=1">http://example.com/?clear_cache=1</a></p></li>

<p>Happy June!</p>

<p>I know a lot of you have questions related to the past couple of releases of FeedWordPress that I haven't yet gotten back to you about. I'm sorry it's taking a while, but I have been reading all the questions and reports coming in, and have been working on resolving a number of issues reported, while also doing a lot of work under the hood in order to improve FeedWordPress's extensibility and to allow add-on modules to more thoroughly extend FeedWordPress's user interface and features. I don't have much to say about the under-the-hood changes just yet (I'll have more to say about them as they prove themselves in practical uses in the future). But for now, I thought it would be important to push out another public release which will wrap up some of the improvements and fixes made in response to user questions and reports. There are several questions and issues still outstanding that I will be working on soon, but my wedding anniversary is coming up and I'll be out of town and away from work for the next few days, so I wanted to make sure that these fixes get out before I leave town. The rest are things that I'll be getting to when I get back this weekend.</p>

<p>Here's a quick breakdown of the changes you might notice between the previous release and FeedWordPress 2010.0602:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CATEGORY BOX INTERFACE ELEMENT FIXED FOR WP 3.0:</strong> Stylesheet changes
between WordPress 2.9.x and the WordPress 3.0 RC caused the Categories
box under <strong>Syndication --&gt; Categories &amp; Tags</strong> to malfunction. This
has been fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LINK CATEGORY SELECTION BOX IN SYNDICATION ==&gt; FEEDS FIXED FOR WP 2.8
AND 2.9:</strong> A WP 3.0 compatibility change introduced in 2010.0531
inadvertently broke the Syndicated Link Category selector under
Syndication --&gt; Feeds &amp; Updates in WP 2.8 and WP 2.9, causing the post
categories to be displayed in the selector rather than the link
categories. This should now be fixed so that the selector will work
correctly under both the current versions of WordPress and the 3.0 RC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MORE PERMISSIVE HANDLING OF FEEDS WITH BAD CONTENT-TYPE HEADERS:</strong> One of
the small advantages that MagpieRSS had over SimplePie is that it was
more tolerant about parsing well-formed feeds that the remote web server
happened to deliver with weird or incorrect HTTP Content-type headers.
In feeds affected by this problem, the new SimplePie parser would simply
fail to find a feed, due to its being led astray by the contents of the
Content-type header. This version includes an extension to SimplePie's
content-type sniffer that offers more permissive handling of the HTTP
headers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MORE FULL-TEXT "EXCERPTS" NOW PROPERLY SHORTENED.</strong> Version 2010.0528
introduced code to control for cases in which elements intended for
item summaries are (ill-advisedly) used to carry the full text of posts;
past versions of FeedWordPress would simply include the full text of the
post in the excerpt field, but newer versions now attempt to detect
this condition when it arises and to head it off, by blanking out the
excerpt field and filling it with an automatically generated short,
plain text excerpt from the full content. This release broadens the
test conditions that indicate when an excerpt field is treated as
identical to the full text of the post, and should therefore improve
the handling of some feeds (such as Google Reader feeds) where the full
text of each post was still appearing in the excerpt field.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FILTERS: <code>syndicated_item_published</code> AND <code>syndicated_item_updated</code>
FILTERS NOW ALLOW FILTER AUTHORS TO CHANGE POST TIMESTAMPS.</strong> You can now
use the <code>syndicated_item_published</code> and <code>syndicated_item_updated</code> filter
hooks to write filters or add-ons which directly change the post date
and most-recently-updated timestamps on incoming syndicated posts. Props
to <strong>niska</strong> for pointing out where the filters needed to be applied in
order to change WordPress's internal timestamps for incoming posts.</p></li>
</ul>

Also, as I mentioned, I will be out of town for the next few days. Please don't let this stop you from sending in your questions -- I'll be reading through everything that came in while I was away. Just be aware that I'll be getting back to you sometime around early next week.</p>

    <div class="content"><p><a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/feedwordpress.2010.0531.zip">FeedWordPress 2010.0531 is now available for download.</a></p>

<p>I put out this update quckly because it contains fixes to a couple of important issues that y'all helped me to discover in early user reports back about <a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/blogs/radgeek/2010/05/28/feedwordpress-20100528-four-updates-one">FeedWordPress 2010.0528</a>. Most of the issues that you reported are issues that are linked, in one way or another, to memory consumption, and to running up against the memory constraints provided by PHP. I will be working on some changes over the next several days to FeedWordPress's internal handling of feed data, and the new MagpieRSS compatibility layer, which I hope will help to alleviate the problems with memory consumption, but I wanted to make sure that this bugfix release was issued as quickly as possible in order to help avert a couple of other problems -- database performance problems during updates, and problems with certain syndicated items not having the syndication meta-data properly attached. (This would result in posts appearing as if they were authored locally, without meta-data about syndication source, with permalinks pointing back to the aggregator website, etc.) Both of these issues were actually caused by a common problem, which I believe has been resolved by the changes in this release. I apologize for the difficulties, and want to thank the users who sent me the detailed, informative bug reports that helped me identify the part of the code that needed to be tested, track down the issue, and eliminate the bug. As a result of one part of this fix, it will be much more difficult in the future for any error condition to result in syndicated posts to lose their custom fields or to end up being improperly sourced in the future.</p>

<p>Here's a quick breakdown of the major changes since the release of FeedWordPress 2010.0531:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>PERMALINK / CUSTOM FIELDS PROBLEM RESOLVED:</strong> An issue in 2010.0528 caused some significant performance problems when updating feeds, and caused
some posts to be imported without the proper syndication-related
meta-data being attached (thus causing permalinks to point back to the
aggregator website rather than to the source website, among other
problems). This problem has been resolved (and a fix has been applied
which will resolve the problem for any posts affected by this problem,
if the original post is recent enough to still be available on the feed).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UI: The "Back End" section has been split into two separate sections</strong> --
"Performance" (dealing with caching, database index, and other
performance tweaks), and "Diagnostics" (dealing with debug mode,
update logging, and a number of new diagnostic tests which I will be
rolling out over the next few releases).</p></li>
<li><p>Several minor interface bugs and PHP warning notices have also been eliminated.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="content"><p><a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/feedwordpress.2010.0528.zip">FeedWordPress 2010.0528 is now available for download</a>.</p>

<p>This is a major release with many changes, fixes, and new features. Actually, this post will be covering a lot more than just what went into the most recent public release -- if you compared the version numbers in the Download box to the blog posts, you may have noticed that I put out a good three public releases that didn't have corresponding announcements on the blog. (Versions 2009.1111, 2009.1112, and 2010.0127. The reasons, basically, had to do with major releases being postponed for a couple months while I worked on some major internal overhauls, and then ending up with some important stuff to push out, but not having time to get the package's ChangeLog up to date. Since the announcement posts are based on the ChangeLog, the announcement posts didn't go up either.</p>

<p>So, here is my big, fat list of changes since FeedWordPress 2009.0707, the last version that I wrote a blog post about. Some of the most important changes are not obviously visible to end-users, but will make a very big difference: in particular, <strong>FeedWordPress  is no longer depends on MagpieRSS for feed parsing</strong>; it now uses the SimplePie module included with versions of WordPress since version 2.8. SimplePie is much more up to date than MagpieRSS, handles modern feed formats just fine, and is designed with a great deal of flexibility in mind, so the transition should eliminate some common causes of parsing and update errors; it also means that I no longer have to worry about maintaining an unauthorized upgrade to WordPress core modules, and <strong>this should eliminate one of the most common causes of sudden unexpected feed errors</strong> (the <q><a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/blogs/radgeek/2008/04/18/upgrade-downgrade">Upgrade Downgrade</a></q> problem will no longer exist). SimplePie's greater extensibility will also allow many more options in the future for developing extensions or alternatives for users who prefer different arrangements with regard to feed caching or other tasks related to the parser.</p>

<p>(Don't worry, if you use existing filters and add-ons that depend on MagpieRSS's format for feed data. This version includes a compatibility layer that will mock up Magpie's data format from SimplePie objects, and ensure that existing add-ons and filters do not break.)</p>

<p>Some other important new features include <strong>syntax for storing feed meta-data in custom fields</strong> for syndicated posts; allowing you to protect <strong>manual edits to syndicated posts from being overwritten by updates from the feed</strong>; <strong>settings to help you control update scheduling</strong>; <strong>more resilient handling of dates</strong> (so that feed formats with unusual or broken date formats should no longer result in posts being dated back to 1969 or 1970), and a number of other interface tweaks, compatibility fixes, and some bug fixes around the edges. Here's a breakdown of the major changes since the release of FeedWordPress 2009.0707.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>SIMPLEPIE IS NOW USED TO PARSE FEEDS; NO MORE MAGPIERSS UPGRADES NEEDED:</strong>
One of the biggest changes in this release is that FeedWordPress no
longer depends on MagpieRSS to parse feeds, and has switched to the much
more up-to-date and flexible SimplePie feed parser, which is included as
a standard part of WordPress versions 2.8 and later. Using SimplePie will
hopefully allow for better handling of feeds going further, and will
allow me greater flexibility in determining how exactly the feed parser
will operate. It also means that FeedWordPress no longer requires
special upgrades to the WordPress core MagpieRSS files, and should
eliminate quite a bit of complexity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MAGPIERSS COMPATIBILITY LAYER FOR EXISTING FILTERS AND ADD-ONS:</strong> However,
I have also implemented a compatibility layer to ensure that existing
filters and add-ons for FeedWordPress which depended on the MagpieRSS
data format <em>should not be broken</em> by the switch to SimplePie. Going
forward, I recommend that new filters and add-ons be written to take
advantage of the SimplePie object representations of items, feeds, etc.,
rather than the MagpieRSS arrays, but the MagpieRSS arrays will still
be available and older filters should continue to work as they have in
the past.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>COMPATIBILITY WITH WORDPRESS 2.9.x and 3.0:</strong> This release has been tested
for the existing WordPress 2.9.x branch and with the upcoming release of
WordPress 3.0.  Changes in the user interface JavaScript between WordPress
2.8.x and WordPress 2.9 caused the tag box interface element to break in
the Syndication --&gt; Categories &amp; Tags settings page; changes in the API
functions for adding new authors caused fatal errors under certain
conditions in WordPress 3.0. These breakages have been fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DROPPED LEGACY SUPPORT FOR WORDPRESS PRIOR TO 2.8:</strong> Because SimplePie is
not included with versions of WordPress prior to 2.8, I have chosen to
drop legacy support for WordPress versions 1.5 through 2.7. If you are
using FeedWordPress with a version of WordPress before 2.8, you will
have to upgrade your installation of WordPress in order to take
advantage of this release.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PHP 5.3 COMPATIBILITY:</strong> A couple of compatibility issues, which were
causing fatal errors amd ugly warnings for users of PHP 5.3,
have been eliminated.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Features and Processing</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>INTERFACE REORGANIZATION:</strong> The interface restructuring, began with
Version 2009.0612, has been completed. Catch-all settings pages have
been eliminated entirely for pages that cover each aspect of handling
a feed: Feeds &amp; Updates, Posts &amp; Links, Authors, Categories &amp; Tags,
and Back End handling of the database and diagnostic information.
Extensive new interface hooks allow add-on modules to significantly
change or extend the FeedWordPress admin interface and workflow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>STORING INFORMATION FROM THE FEED IN CUSTOM FIELDS:</strong> Many users
have written to request the ability to store information from elements
in the feed in a custom field on each post. (So that, for example, if
post includes a <code>itunes:duration</code> element, you could store the contents
in a Custom Field called <code>duration</code> on the post (for a Theme to access
later). The Custom Post Settings under Syndication --&gt; Posts &amp; Links now
allow you to access any item or feed tag, using a syntax similar to
a much-simplified version of XPath. See Posts &amp; Links settings for
details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UPDATE-FREEZING ON MANUALLY EDITED POSTS:</strong> FeedWordPress now allows you
to mark posts that have been manually edited, so that the changes you
make will not be overwritten by later updates from the feed. If you make
manual edits to a particular post, just check the "Manual editing"
checkbox in order to protect your changes from being overwritten. If you
want to block <em>all</em> posts from being updated after they are imported
for the first time, a new "Updated Posts" setting in Posts &amp; Links
allows you to freeze all posts from a particular feed, or all syndicated
posts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SETTING: FEED-BY-FEED SETTINGS FOR WHERE PERMALINKS POINT TO:</strong> You've
always been able to tell FeedWordPress whether permalinks for posts
should point to the original source of the story or the local copy. Now
you can choose different policies for different feeds, instead of one
global policy for all feeds. (Of course, you can still use a global
default if you prefer.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SETTING: USER CONTROL OVER TIMING BASIS.</strong> You can now determine the
schedule on which feeds are considered ready to poll for updates --
by default feeds become ready for polling after about 1 hour. You can
now increase or decrease the time window under Syndication --&gt; Feeds &amp;
Updates. (However, please pay <em>CAREFUL ATTENTION</em> to the recommendations
and DO NOT set the scheduling lower than 60 minutes unless you are
ABSOLUTELY SURE that you have specific permission from webmaster who
provides that specific feed to poll more frequently than that. If you
set this too low (and about 60 minutes is the polite minimum if you
haven't been given a different figure), most webmasters will consider
the frequent hits on their server as rude, or even downright abusive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OTHER SETTINGS:</strong> New settings also include the ability to stop FWP from
resolving relative URLs within syndicated content, and the ability to
choose whether FeedWordPress should indicate the comment feed from the
original source, or the local comment feed, when providing the comment
feed URL for a syndicated post.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Parsing</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>BETTER DATE HANDLING -- FEWER FLASHBACKS TO 1969 and 1970:</strong> FeedWordPress
has made some bugfixes and some improvements in the logic for parsing
dates. This should allow FeedWordPress to correctly parse more dates in
more feeds; and, in the last resort, when FeedWordPress fails to
correctly parse a date, to fall back to a more intelligent default. This
should hopefully avoid most or all error conditions that have resulted
in articles being erroneously dated to the dawn of the Unix epoch
(31 December 1969 or 1 January 1970).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FULL-TEXT "EXCERPTS" NOW PROPERLY SHORTENED.</strong> Based on a straightforward
reading of the existing RSS specs, it's reasonable for the
rss:description element to be read as a plaintext summary or excerpt for
the item containing the description -- with the full text of the item,
if available, in another, better-suited element, such as the de facto
standard content:encoded extension element. The problem is that uses of
RSS rarely have much to do with anything like a straightforward reading
of the specs. As a result, many actual RSS producers in the wild put the
full text of the article in a description element. But since
FeedWordPress has treated this text as a summary, this produces
aggregated posts with lengthy "excerpts" containing the full text of the
article. This release of FeedWordPress fixes the problem by doing a
little digging before treating rss:description as a summary: if the
description element is used properly as a plain text summary, then
FeedWordPress will take the summary provided by the feed, rather than
recreating its own excerpt from the full text; but if an RSS item has no
full-text element other than description, FeedWordPress will treat the
description element as the full text of the article, and generate a
shortened excerpt automatically from that text.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>API</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TEMPLATE API:</strong> new template tags <code>get_local_permalink()</code> and
<code>the_local_permalink()</code> allow you to access the permalink for a post on
your aggregator site, even when FeedWordPress is rewriting permalinks to
point to the original source site.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NEW HOOKS FOR ADD-ONS AND FILTERS:</strong> I have added a number of new hooks
which allow add-on modules to filter more precisely, gather information
at more points, and to enhance the FeedWordPress admin interface. For
a list of new hooks and documentation, see the FeedWordPress
documentation wiki at
<a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/wiki/add-ons-and-filters">http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/wiki/add-ons-and-filters</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>FILTER API:</strong> A number of new utility methods have been added to the
SyndicatedPost  class to make it easier for filters and add-ons to</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FILTER API: Globals $fwp_channel and $fwp_feedmeta DEPRECATED.</strong> These
global variables, originally introduced to allow filters access to
information about the source feed in <code>syndicated_item</code> filters (which
were passed in through global   variables rather than as parameters
because of a bug in WP 1.5 which was then fixed in 1.5.1) have been
DEPRECATED. If you have any filters or add-ons which still depend on
these global variables, you should see about fixing them to access data
about the source feed using the SyndicatedPost::link element instead.
For documentation, see the FeedWordPress documentation wiki at
<a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/wiki/syndicatedpost">http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/wiki/syndicatedpost</a> and
<a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/wiki/syndicatedlink">http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/wiki/syndicatedlink</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DIAGNOSTICS:</strong> I've included a number of new diagnostic options and
messages, which should allow an experienced user to better investigate
any problems that may crop up.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>BUGFIX: &amp; IN PERMALINKS NO LONGER CAUSING ATOM OR HTML VALIDATION
ERRORS:</strong> Many users reported an issue in which syndicating a feed with
special XML characters in the URLs (&amp; was the most common, since it is
used to separate HTTP GET parameters) would cause the aggregator's
feeds to produce invalid (malformed) XML. This update addresses the
issue in Atom feeds. Unfortunately, it has not been technically possible
to address the problem in RSS 2.0 feeds, due to limitations on
WordPress's internal templates for RSS feeds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BUGFIX: BROKEN URLS IN "POPULAR POSTS" AND SIMILAR PLUGINS SHOULD NO
LONGER BE BROKEN.</strong> A number of users noticed an issue where plugins and
templates that listed posts in locations outside of the post loop
(for example, "Popular Posts"-style plugins that listed posts in the
sidebar), often produced the wrong URL for post links. (Typically, all
the posts listed would get the same wrong URL.) This should now be
fixed. Thanks to Björn for sending in a quick fix!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MINOR BUGFIXES:</strong> This release includes a number of fixes to minor bugs
and compatibility issues, including: silent failures of the "Syndicate"
button, "Illegal Offset Type" error messages from MagpieRSS, and others.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="content"><p><a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/feedwordpress.2009.0707.zip">FeedWordPress 2009.0707 is now available for download.</a></p>

<p>This is a release to fix two bugs, one small and slightly irritating, and the other potentially very irritating, which resulted from changes to the AJAX interface elements between WordPress 2.7 and 2.8.</p>

<p>Let's start with the more irritating problem which you should be able to eliminate by upgrading to the most recent release:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>BUGFIX: WORDPRESS 2.8 AJAX COMPATIBILITY ISSUES RESOLVED (blank or
truncated "Syndicated Sites" administration page):</strong> Due to changes in the
AJAX interface elements between WordPress 2.7 and WordPress 2.8, several
FeedWordPress users encountered an issue where the front "Syndication"
page in the FeedWordPress administrative interface would come up blank,
without the normal "Syndicated Sites" list and "Update" control, or
sometimes wth the boxes visible but one or both of them truncated, with
only the title bar. This issue should now be resolved: with the new
version of FeedWordPress, the compatibility issue that caused the
disappearance should be eliminated, and if boxes are shown with only
their handle visible, you should once again be able to drop down the
rest of the box by clicking once on its title bar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you to the many users who brought this issue to my attention, and supplied some very useful screen shots which helped me reproduce and track down the origin of the problem.</p>

<p>The second problem was with the Tags widget (found under <q>Categories &amp; Tags,</q> where you can set tags to be applied to all syndicated posts, or all posts syndicated from a particular feed). This was also the result of some rather capricious changes to the AJAX interface framework in WordPress 2.8.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>BUGFIX: TAG SETTING WIDGET FIXED.</strong> Due to changes in interface elements
between WordPress 2.7 and WordPress 2.8, people using FeedWordPress with
WordPress 2.8 found that the widget for setting tags to be applied to
all syndicated posts, or all syndicated posts from a particular feed,
no longer displayed "Add" and "Remove" buttons for individual tags. This
issue has now been fixed, and the tagging widget should once again work
more or less exactly like the tagging widget for individual posts in the
normal WordPress admin interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Download and enjoy! As always, you have any issues with the release, or if there is anything that you would like to see included in a future release, please use the comments form or <a href="http://radgeek.com/contact">drop me a line</a> to let me know about it.</p>

<p>Now that these bug fixes are out of the way, I have some ambitious plans for the next release of FeedWordPress, which I hope to be able to release by early August at the latest. Besides ongoing testing for compatibility with new releases in the 2.8.x and upcoming 2.9 branches of WordPress, I would like to implement a Category Mapping system, similar to the existing Author Mapping system, which would provide users with much more fine-grained, powerful, and sophisticated tools for controlling how categories or tags from feeds are imported into the WordPress database. As I have time to do so, I would also like to include some commonly-requested features, such as allowing users more control over how excerpts are generated and more precise control over the timing of automatic updates. And eventually I hope to be able to replace the aging MagpieRSS feed parser with the more robust, reliable, and flexible SimplePie feed parser that is now shipping with new releases of WordPress.</p>

<p>If you have benefited from the bug fixes that went into this most recent release, or if you are interested in making sure that powerful new features like Category Mapping can be developed for an upcoming release, please remember that it's your generous gifts to the <a href="http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress/">project tip jar</a> that make ongoing development and support for FeedWordPress possible.</p></div>

<p>This is a bug fix release. Other than a few mainly cosmetic code clean-ups, there is only one change between this release and the previous release, 2009.0613. But it's an important one.</p>

<p>After upgrading to WordPress 2.8, many users reported encountering the following error whenever they attempted to add a new feed through FeedWordPress's feed-finder interface:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>HTTP request failure</h3>
  
  <p>:</p>
  
  <h4>HTTP Transports available:</h4>
  
  <ol>
  <li><code>WP_Http_Fsockopen</code></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I reported earlier that this error was the result of some changes in the HTTP request functions provided by FeedWordPress (changes to the order in which different HTTP transports are used; changes which I think were rather ill-considered). After managing to replicate the problem and investigating more deeply, I found out that it was actually the result of a combination of two factors -- the changes in WordPress 2.8 (which I still think were a mistake) and also a subtle bug in FeedWordPress's feed-finder code, which the changes in the HTTP transport code ended up exposing. In any case, the subtle bug has now been fixed, and with it, the source of <em>most</em> of these HTTP request errors should be eliminated.</p>

<p>So, if you've been encountering this problem, be sure to download the most recent FeedWordPress. Then, after it's installed, <em>make sure you also upgrade your MagpieRSS</em> to the version included with the most recent FeedWordPress.

    <div class="content"><p><a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/feedwordpress.2009.0613.zip">FeedWordPress version 2009.0613 is now available for download.</a></p>

<p>This is a very minor update, which I guess should not be too much of a surprise, if you take into account the fact that <a href="http://projects.radgeek.com/2009/06/12/feedwordpress-20090612/">I made a major release just yesterday</a>. However, due to some difficulties that some people have been having, I thought it would be a good idea to push out a release with better diagnostics.</p>

<p>The basic issue is this: until WordPress version 2.7, FeedWordPress used the Snoopy HTTP library (which is included in WordPress) to fetch feeds for updating, and also for the <q>feed finder</q> that helps you subscribe to new feeds in the administrative interface. With WordPress 2.7, however, the WordPress team decided to deprecate Snoopy -- so it's still included with WordPress, but not used internally, and it may be dropped from future releases -- and to introduce <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/http.php">a new custom API for HTTP requests</a> (the WP_Http class and some wrapper functions that make use of it). So, if you're using WordPress 2.7.x or 2.8, FeedWordPress uses the new functions rather than the deprecated Snoopy module. One of the advantages of the new code is that it is supposed to be able to make use of any of several different HTTP transport APIs which may be available, depending on your PHP set-up (for example libcurl, fsockopen, URL support in fopen, etc.). But I've been noticing problems that many users have had that tie back to problems with the underlying HTTP transports used by WordPress's new code, and, for reasons that are unclear to me, the WordPress development team decided to make some changes in WordPress 2.8 which make these problems even more likely to occur and even harder to get around. In any case, this is almost certainly the underlying issue if you, like others, are encountering something like this when you try to syndicate a new feed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Error:</strong> I couldn’t find any feeds at &lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt; [HTTP request error: :]. Try another URL</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best solution for you will depend on details about your own hosting situation -- in particular, what version of WordPress you are using FeedWordPress with, and whether or not you are able to install new PHP modules on your web host, or, if not, whether or not you have someone who is willing to install new PHP modules for you. Unfortunately it's not likely to be something that FeedWordPress itself can fix. But I have made some updates so that FeedWordPress will, at least, provide some more useful diagnostic information -- which may help you figure out what needs to be done, or which will hep me help you figure it out, if you send the diagnostic information to me along with your support request.</p>

<p>So, anyway, all that said, that's why I'm pushing out a new release today. (There are also a couple other minor changes included in the release, but I would probably not have bothered with a public release just yet except for the number of support requests I've gotten since yesterday's release, which the diagnostics would help with.) Other than some under-the-hood re-arranging of the code, here are the significant changes between 2009.0613 and the previous releas, 2009.0612:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>INTERFACE/BUGFIX: WORDPRESS 2.8 CATEGORY BOX FIX.</strong> Thanks to a subtle
change in class names between the WordPress 2.7 and 2.8 stylesheets,
category boxes in the FeedWordPress settings interface tended to overflow
and have a lot of messy-looking overlapping text under WordPress 2.8.
This has now been fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FeedFinder FAILURE DIAGNOSTICS:</strong> When FWP's FeedFinder fails to find any
feeds at a given URL (for example, when you are trying to add a
subscription through the administrative interface and you run into an
error message), FeedWordPress now provides more diagnostic information
for the reasons behind the failure. If that helps you, great; if not,
it should help me respond more intelligently to your support request..</p></li>
</ul>
