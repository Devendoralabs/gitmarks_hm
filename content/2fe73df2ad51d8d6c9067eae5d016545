<span class="date">May 25th, 19:05 by MSo Lambert</span>
<p>Let me start with an apology. I am extremely sorry for this recent Subscribe-O-Matic outage and the trouble it has caused. One thing I'm personally always proud of is the reliability of our service. Even though we host thousands of groups and help you send millions of messages each month, we haven't had any major outages in the last 3 years, apart from a few minutes of maintenance every now and then. Yet in the last 24 hours, Subscribe-O-Matic was unavailable for over 8 hours. So what happened?</p>

<h2><a href="http://blog.subscribeomatic.com/2010/03/scheduled-maintenance-march-2010/">Scheduled Maintenance: March 7th, 2010</a></h2>
<span class="date">Mar 6th, 20:51 by MSo Lambert</span>
<p><p>To pave the road for the upcoming Subscribe-O-Matic upgrades, we're moving the service to a shiny new server (and a different datacenter). I'm not expecting any downtime (hence the short notice), but there might be a few short disruptions in form of not being able to send messages or new members not being able to subscribe, since we'll be locking the database for write access while we migrate everything.</p></p>

<span class="date">Dec 30th 2009, 19:47 by MSo Lambert</span>
<p><p>We recently got a Holiday e-card from Google, stating they donated US$ 20M to charity organizations around the world. We immediately wanted to match their donation, but our CFO found out that we are a little under US$ 20M short.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot support good people with money donations just yet, but we've been doing our best to provide free Subscribe-O-Matic groups to numerous charity and educational organizations around Second Life along with other non-profit and community groups.</p></p>

<span class="date">Dec 4th 2009, 02:40 by Salvatore Talaj</span>
<p><p>We were just way too busy to write anything on the blog. Wait - we didn't even have a blog!</p>
<p>Even though we've been quite busy in the last few months, we probably haven't been updating you on our current website as much as we should. To remedy this, we put up this blog so we can keep you in the loop more easily, let you know what's going on behind the scenes, what we're planning and also post a handy tip or two.</p></p>

<h2>Introducing the Subscribe-O-Matic Support Center</h2>
<span class="date">February 5th, 2009 by MSo Lambert</span>
<p>In our continuous effort to provide quality support for our service, we have launched the new Support Center.</p>
<p>
Our new Support Center is available to everyone and is the preferred way of contacting us. You can access the Support Center online at 
<a href="http://support.subscribeomatic.com">http://support.subscribeomatic.com</a> or you can also open a support ticket automatically by 
sending an email to <strong>support (at) subscribeomatic.com</strong>.
</p>
<p>If you have an existing Subscribe-O-Matic subscription (free or paid plan), you can log in with your existing Subscribe-O-Matic email and password. 
	If you didn't provide an email address in your Subscribe-O-Matic <a href="owners/settings">Account settings</a>, you can either enter your email in the Subscribe-O-Matic 
	account settings, or register a new support account at Support Center. 
	We suggest you use your exact avatar name for the <strong>Full name</strong> field.
</p>
<p>
Support Center registration is optional and will enable you to view your tickets online, comment and rate knowledgebase articles, etc. If you open a new ticket without registering, 
a new account will be created for you automatically, and you will the confirmation email with your login details included.
</p><p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Try searching the knowledgebase</strong> - we will be expanding our knowledgebase with new articles constantly, and there might already be an article that can 
		help you out. You can either browse the knowledgebase categories or use the search widget on the right side of the page.</li>
	<li><strong>Submit a ticket if you can't find the answer</strong> - click the <a href="http://support.subscribeomatic.com/index.php?_m=tickets&_a=submit">Submit a Ticket</a> link
		 on the Support Center main page to start.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Subscribe-O-Matic goes free</h2>
<span class="date">September 29th, 2008 by MSo Lambert</span>
<p>
Since we officially launched Subscribe-O-Matic last year, it has spread rapidly through Second Life, 
the blogosphere, and especially the Second Life fashion community. It's been an exciting year, 
with a lot of growth related challenges and occasional Second Life grid issues. Today, Subscribe-O-Matic groups 
have almost half a million members, and send close to three million messages and items across the grid
each month.</p>
<p>Despite that, we believe there is still a lot of room for improvement, both in terms of functionality, and affordability. With this in mind, we are making Subscribe-O-Matic <strong>completely free for all groups with up to 500 members</strong>.
Our 14-day trial has been discontinued, so everyone can now create a Subscribe-O-Matic group, either for commercial or personal purposes, without any costs involved. We have also increased the member limit for our paid subscription plan and
lowered the price substantially, to make the transition to Unlimited plan much more gradual. So if you have a group with 700 members for example, you will now be paying <strong>L$4,000 less per month</strong>. Please check the <a href="/pages/pricing">pricing page</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
We have also been working on some features (some of which are exclusive to our biggest groups), which will enable you to make the most out of your Subscribe-O-Matic group. One of them is the 3rd-party integration API which will allow you to integrate 
Subscribe-O-Matic with other Second Life tools and services - stay tuned for the official announcement as the beta version becomes available.
