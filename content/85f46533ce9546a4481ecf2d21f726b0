All submissions         undergo a double-blind peer-review process.</p>        <p>SoTL is a key way to improve teaching effectiveness, student learning          outcomes, and the continuous transformation of academic cultures and          communities. Through research questions and methodologies applied to          teaching and learning, the making public of that research and its          results so that it can be analyzed and critiqued, and through the          constructing of an available, growing body of knowledge, understanding,          and wisdom about the teaching and learning processes and  outcomes,          college and university teaching is seen as a serious intellectual          activity that can be evidence and outcome based.</p>        <p>SoTL is an international momentum or movement. <em>IJ-SoTL</em> seeks to be a          virtual SoTL Commons for research articles, invited essays, and          reflections about the value, implementation, and development of SoTL in          various academic contexts and cultures. The Editorial Review Board of           <span mm:togglevisibility="italic"><em>IJ-SoTL</em></span> is profoundly strong and international in scope, and the goal is          for submissions, published papers, and the readership to be truly          international. Through email, published responses to articles, and a          listserv, <em>IJ-SoTL</em> encourages your participation, questions and comments          in order to foster international conversations about SoTL, as well as          international collaboration in SoTL.</p>        <p>The bamboo plant is the symbol for <em>IJ-SoTL</em>. It grows around of the          world, it grows rapidly, its sections are as steps in the process of          growth and awareness, and it always has green shoots and leaves as signs          of its vitality. Bamboo has been a symbol for longevity, strength and          grace. It bends without breaking while having a tensile strength          similar to steel. It has had a great reputation in both ancient and          modern civilizations for its effective uses and for taking root in all          sorts of climates. Such is SoTL and such is the goal for <em>IJ-SoTL</em>.</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan="2" class="footer"><p align="center"><em>International Journal         for the Scholarship of Teaching &amp; Learning</em> is a publication of         <br>        the Center for Teaching, Learning &amp; Scholarship at Georgia Southern         University, Statesboro, Georgia, USA<br>        Technical Editor: Steve Bonham | Painting: &quot;Bamboo and Damselfly&quot;         by Teresa L.
