<p>
I thought Ligaya Turmelle&#39;s <a href="http://www.khankennels.com/blog/index.php/archives/2007/04/20/getting-joins">post on SQL joins</a> was a great primer for novice developers. Since SQL joins <i>appear</i> to be set-based, the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">Venn diagrams</a> to explain them seems, at first blush, to be a natural fit. However, like the commenters
    to her post, I found that the Venn diagrams didn&#39;t quite match the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)">
        SQL join syntax</a>
    reality in my testing.<p>
        I love the concept, though, so let&#39;s see if we can make it work. Assume we have the following two tables. <strong>Table A</strong> is on the left, and 
    <strong>Table B</strong> is on the right. We&#39;ll populate them with four records each.
<p>
<pre>id name       id  name
-- ----       --  ----
1  <font color="red">Pirate</font>     1   Rutabaga
2  Monkey     2   <font color="red">Pirate</font>
3  <font color="red">Ninja</font>      3   Darth Vader
4  Spaghetti  4   <font color="red">Ninja</font></pre>
<p>
Let&#39;s join these tables by the name field in a few different ways and see if we can get a conceptual match to those nifty Venn diagrams.
<p>
<table cellpadding="6" cellspacing="4" width="900">

    <p>
        There&#39;s also a cartesian product or <strong>cross join</strong>, which as far as
        I can tell, can&#39;t be expressed as a Venn diagram:</p>
<pre>SELECT * FROM TableA
<b>CROSS JOIN</b> TableB
</pre>        
        
    <p>
        This joins &quot;everything to everything&quot;, resulting in 4 x 4 = 16 rows, far more than we
        had in the original sets. If you do the math, you can see why this is a <em>very</em>
        dangerous join to run against large tables.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sophisticated enough to use databases anymore (my career as a developer has devolved), but when I was, 99% of the time I used inner joins and just thought of it as the data common to both tables.  <br />
Every now and then I wanted some data that didn&#39;t fit that kind of join and I&#39;d do a left outer join to get the data that was &quot;left out&quot;.</p>

<p>Speaking about Oracle (+) syntax and LEFT/RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN syntax there is a difference. And it is nicely described here<br />
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/10/01/whatsinacondition.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/10/01/whatsinacondition.html</a></p>

<p>Speaking about ANSI syntax where everyone has to explicitly say to make CROSS JOIN to get Cartesian product at least in Oracle it is not true, using stupid (at least to my mind) NATURAL JOIN clause one can easily get CROSS JOIN and also JOIN on such columns he never thought it really is. I&#39;ve blogged about it here<br />
<a href="http://gplivna.blogspot.com/2007/10/natural-joins-are-evil-motto-if-you.html" rel="nofollow">http://gplivna.blogspot.com/2007/10/natural-joins-are-evil-motto-if-you.html</a><br />
Don&#39;t know wehether it is just Oracle specific or as per ANSI SQL standard.</p>

<p>Speaking about INNNER JOINS as a Cartesian product and then eliminating all unnecessary rows, at least the real mechanics in Oracle is absolutely different, there are following possibilities for doing them:<br />
NESTED LOOPS (OUTER)<br />
HASH JOIN (OUTER)<br />
MERGE JOIN (OUTER)<br />
and for Cartesian product it uses MERGE JOIN CARTESIAN, and that&#39;s when usually the real trouble (filling temp) starts ;)<br />
The real choice among Nested loops, hash join or merge join at least depends on data, statistics, available memory for a session, explicitly given available memory for hash joins or merge joins (btw there is possibility to give for one but not for other), system workload, hints, initialization parameters allowing ceratain join types (at least for hash joins) and probably something other :)</p>

<p>Hi Jeff, </p>

<p>I think your illustrations make one BIG assumption: Table A and Table B contain unique rows. If either table contained duplicate matching records, then the whole Venn diagram will not hold (the cardinality of the sets will not add up). I am afraid this visual explanation will lead some to think that you can use SQL joins to do filter operations which shouldn&#39;t be done this way. </p>

<p>Although it&#39;s nice attempt to explain SQL joins, overall I think it is misleading.</p>

<p>One of the worst three months of my CS training was a class ostensibly on database theory which was really a boot-camp in SQL syntax, taught by a Johnny-one-note professor who thought SQL and RDMSs were the greatest invention of mankind.</p>

<p>This experience turned me off databases for 15 years until one day in the shower I realized that joins were analogous to set theory, in a rough way.  (Yes they are, all you naysayers!  &quot;Give me everything that&#39;s there AND there&quot; or &quot;Give me everything that&#39;s there OR there&quot; may not handle all the possible inputs, but it&#39;s a good jumping off point for explaining &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer.&quot;  And who came up with that stupid, arbitrary terminology anyway?)</p>

<p>I still think SQL is an awful language, though, and relational databases are an ugly hack mandated by hardware limitations trumping elegant design.  OLAP &quot;cubes&quot; are so clearly a better solution---so intuitively clear and obvious---the natural generalization to higher dimensions of the flat-file database.</p>

<p>To me, a Cartesian Product would be best illustrated by both circles being blank.</p>

<p>Well, the database practitioner rejoice, and the set relationists cringe.</p>

<p>There is only one join, which is the cross product (each row of the first table concatenated to each row of the second table). The INNER JOIN example only discards some rows by the where clause, otherwise it is (or should be) the same as the CROSS JOIN. The outer join is a hack that isn&#39;t very firmly rooted in relational algebra.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget EXCEPT! Which was (and additionally still is) MINUS in Oracle. For years I think Oracle was the only RDBMS that implemented it and I had, in nearly 20 years, used it all of, oh, once. Until last week, when I used it the second time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same as your fourth example: instead of</p>

<p>SELECT * FROM TableA<br />
LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB<br />
ON TableA.name = TableB.name<br />
WHERE TableB.id IS null</p>

<p>we can say</p>

<p>SELECT * FROM TableA<br />
MINUS<br />
SELECT * FROM TableB</p>

<p>(I used the old Oracle operator - it&#39;s more expressive to my eyes)</p>

<p>Not every platform implements the operator yet: MySQL (which I just checked) doesn&#39;t, for example. MS SQL Server 2005 does. SQLIte? Hang on ...  yup, that works in v3 at least.</p>

<p>Very strange. In my &quot;Database Management&quot; class at Arizona State University - a student asked about Join&#39;s and my professor said &quot;I never use them. Just stick with the WHERE syntax&quot;. </p>

<p>This was a more theoretical course though. We spent FAR more time in relational algebra / calculus and algorithms for ensuring atomic transactions than we did in more practical stuff like database normalization.</p>

<p>Ricardo, that syntax is pre-ANSI.  Most databases still support it but the advantages of the INNER JOIN, etc. syntax are: it makes the queries more portable across databases; it allows separation of the join criteria from the filter criteria, which improves readability; and allows full outer joins without syntactic hacks.</p>

<p>Another huge benefit is that if you want to do a CROSS (Cartesian) JOIN, and usually you don&#39;t, you have to call it out specifically.  In the old syntax, if you screwed up the WHERE clause you could get wildly huge resultsets due to inadvertent Cartesian joins.</p>

<p>I must agree that while the diagrams are a fairly good illustrations of what happens with a join, they&#39;re not Venn diagrams in the strict sense because that&#39;s just not what&#39;s happening. What the first diagram says to me is that you get all records that are both in set A and set B (aka intersection). That&#39;s just not true. You get a set of new records, that are neither in set A nor in set B, but they contain a combination of the attributes of both sets.</p>

<p>Aaron G: joins are conceptually a special case of the cartesian product. How the database server actually computes them is another matter entirely.</p>

<p>Conceptually, in relational algebra, an inner join is a cross product followed by a selection on the join condition. That&#39;s a terribly inefficient way to compute it, but conceptually, that&#39;s what it is.</p>

<p>&quot;I was under the impression that INNER JOINs use a hash match internally (in fact, I&#39;m quite certain of this). CROSS JOINs obviously don&#39;t. Therefore I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s reasonable to say that an IJ is just a special case of the CJ. I suppose in bread-and-butter set theory, where there&#39;s no notion of a hash or an index, this could work, but this is the world of CS, where the clean academic solution is almost never the most practical one. The IJ you speak of is the naivest possible algorithm, only used when there are no indexes (and if you&#39;re designing databases without any indexes, well... stop designing databases).&quot;  -- Aaron G</p>

<p>An IJ is defined as being the equivalent of a filtered CJ.  The fact that this would not be a reasonable implementation does not make a difference.</p>

<p>IJs are ABSOLUTELY NOT implemented exclusively with hash algorithms. Sort merge algorithms and nested loop algorithms are used frequently.</p>

<p>Interesting.  I find joins to be pretty obvious personally.  Fundamentally, you have two sets of rows, and you&#39;re matching them up by some criteria.  In an inner join, you only take rows that match up.  In a left outer join, you take all the ones from the left, plus the ones from the right that match.  In a right outer join, the opposite.  If you have multiple matches, you take all possible combinations of them.</p>

<p>Some DBMS&#39; has syntax with more descriptive verbs (e.g., &#39;Merge&#39;, &#39;Subset&#39;, &#39;Reject&#39;), and Venn diagrams as well in the vendor documentation.</p>

For a long time, I thought I understood that statement because I had this Venn-diagram understanding of joins.</p>

<p>Joins do not map directly to the basic additive operations of set theory (union, intersect, difference), which create new sets by way of simply including or excluding elements of other sets.  There are ways to get those in SQL, but it involves chaining UNION and MINUS statements.</p>

<p>Joins, rather, are mapping operations, which create new sets by taking an element from each set, according to a set of rules, and lumping them together in a new element for the new set that is actually itself a small set containing the original two elements from the other sets.</p>

<p>If A is an additive set operation (representable by a Venn diagram), then the result of A on sets X and Y is a set of members of X and Y.</p>

<p>A(X, Y) = {x1, y1, x2, x3, y4, y5, ...}</p>

<p>In database terms, each element of the resulting set is simply a row from either X or Y.</p>

<p>In real-world terms, it&#39;s like sorting jelly beans.  Throw them all into a bucket, through a sieve.  The sieve eliminates all but the appropriate shaped ones, but what gets through is still what you started with: an assortment of jellybeans.</p>

<p>If B is a mapping set operation (representable by a line-drawing matching question), then the result of B on sets X and Y is a set of sets each containing a member from X and a member of Y.</p>

<p>B(X, Y) = {{x1,y1}, {x2,y2}, {x3,y3}, ...}</p>

<p>In database terms, each element of the resulting set is a new type of row that is a lumping together of a row from X and a row from Y.</p>

<p>In real-world terms, an example would be taking a bucket of oranges and a bucket of apples, and pulling out pairs of one of each that are the same size, putting the pairs together in little bags, and then putting those bags into a third bucket.  You don&#39;t get a bucket of apples and oranges.  You get a bucket of pairs of an apple and an orange.</p>

<p>Looking at it this way, it should be reasonably easy to see that there is a fundamental difference between joins and the simple union/intersect/difference set operations.</p>

<p>&quot;Except that venn diagrams explain set logic, and SQL Joins have very little to do with set logic.</p>

<p>Scary how many people are agreeing with this.<br />

<div class="comments-body robin_day"> 
<p>I&#39;m afraid this concept is misleading on the reasons mentioned by Sven Groot.</p>

<p>The result of a join is not those items in table A and those items in table B, it is a &quot;joined&quot; combination of the two. The diagrams you have drawn are set diagrams and are created in SQL using the set operators UNION and INTERSECT.</p>

<p>Joins are a completely different concept which I believe are best explained using just the table outputs you have above without adding the incorrect venn diagrams.</p>

<p>JF, the explanation behind SELECT and GROUP BY can be described simply.</p>

<p>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM People<br />
-- This will return a count of 100 people</p>

<p>SELECT EyeColour, COUNT(*) FROM People GROUP BY EyeColour<br />
-- This will return Blue 20, Green 50, Brown 30</p>

<p>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM People GROUP BY EyeColour<br />
-- This will return 20, 50, 30 whilst this contains the counts that you are looking for, they are useless as there is no relation to each count and what the represent.</p>

<p>I really have to hand it to you Jeff, the way you break things down is just great.  I read the blogs every time you post one.  This one in particular came in handy just the other day.  Our QA team was having trouble understanding what was going on in the database and we developers would send them queries to run to find the data they needed.  The QA team has a rudimentary understanding of SQL, but couldn&#39;t quite grasp joins.  I sent a link to this article to our lead QA, and now your article is firmly posted on her cube wall for reference.  Just wanted to say thank you for the blogs!</p>
