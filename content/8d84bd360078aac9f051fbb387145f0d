<h1>the problem</h1>

<p>Conventional network visualization is unsuitable for visual
analytics of large networks. So-called <i>hairballs</i> earn their moniker by becoming
impenetrably complex as your network grows. They are least effective when visualization is most needed &mdash; for large networks.

<p><img src="img/linnet-needs-visualization.png" alt="Conventional network visualizations - hairballs - do not scale well. They become unparasable for large networks.">

<em>To really understanding networks visually, we need to be looking at their structure directly and not by proxy through the lens of a layout algorithm based on aesthetics.</em>

<p>More critically, data in conventional visualizations is subordinate
to layout &mdash; node and edge positions and lengths depend as much
on the layout algorithm (of
which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-based_algorithms_%28graph_drawing%29">many
exist</a>), as on the data. The effect of layout rules is difficult to
predict, making direct comparisons of these visualizations impossible. Imagine trying to compare two scatter plots in which the ordinality of the scales were altered (e.g. x=1,2,3,... in one and x=3,1,2,... in the other).

<p>What can you tell from the hairball below? (<a href="http://melihsozdinler.blogspot.com/2010/03/graph-of-day-9-hairball.html">graphminator, 18 mar 2010</a>). I can tell this: hairballs have let us down.

<h1>let's keep the art but improve quantitative visualization</h1>

<p>Don't misunderstand my motivation. I am not trying to dispense with hairballs, <i>per se</i>. In fact, some network visualizations are incredibly beautiful and information graphics would not be the same without them. It would be worse off.

<p><img src="img/linnet-beautiful.png" alt="Beautiful network art is ... beautiful. Let's keep it.">

<p><span class=annot><a href="http://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles/doc/api/y/layout/router/OrganicEdgeRouter.html">y.layout.router</a> Class OrganicEdgeRouter / <a href="http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2007/04/19/twitter-social-network-analysis/">Large Graph Layout</a> (LGL) / Today by Cada / <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/05/05/science/20080506_DISEASE.html">Mapping the Human Disseaseome</a> (Bloch/Corum NYT 2009)</a></p>

<p>The preparation of these kinds of visualizations is an effort of both labour and love. It is difficult to automate and apply in general, and then only with inconsistent results. There are exceptions, in case of specific pairings of network types and layout algorithms (e.g. y.layout.router in first panel above).

<p>Before describing the linear layout method, just to assure you that I love network art, I've taken the hairballs of a <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/data">variety of network communities</a> and generated a "spatter profile". Informative? Somewhat. Juicy? Absolutely. 

<p><a href="img/network-communities.png" alt="Visualization of a variety of networks from different communities."><img src="img/network-communities-small.png" alt="Visualization of a variety of networks from different communities."></a>

<h1>the solution &mdash; the hive plot</h1>

<p>The linear layout presented here addresses the shortcomings of the conventional hairball layout and is very effective at identifying meaningful structural components in your network. These plots are called <i>hive plots</i>.

<em>hive plots are ideal for detecting emerging patterns in your network's structure &mdash; the method shows you the entire network and your brain's pattern matching facilities do the rest.</em>

<p>In this layout, nodes are constrained to linear axes and edges are drawn as curves between nodes. Node position is determined <i>solely</i> by network structure, node, edge annotation, or any other meaningful properties of the network. In other words, layout rules are defined by <i>you</i> based on what properties that are meaningful to you. These rules form a mapping between structure and layout can be as simple or complex as you wish.

<p><img src="img/linnet-layout-01.png">

<p>Critically, there is no aesthetic magic sauce added to the layout. If the layout shows a pattern, you can be sure it is due to structure in the underlying data and not on the layout algorithm's <i>interpretation</i> of how the data should best be shown.

<p>The axis and node mapping is arbitrary and this  may sound very abstract at this point. To make things concrete, there are certain simple recipes that are extremely useful in most cases. 

<p>Mapping to axis (A, in figure below), position (B) and color (C) can be a function of sink/source status (for tripartite networks, this axis categorization is natural), node degree, neighbour degree, or node/edge annotation (e.g. a node could be associated with a classification, or an edge may have a weight).

<p><img src="img/linnet-mapping-01.png">

<p>Interpretation of the linear visualization is easy (once you get the hang of it). Critically, it is possible (unlike hairballs) because the layout rules are based on real data properties, not layout aesthetic. 

<p>Direct visual comparison of hive pltos is possible. 

<p>Finally, it is easy to describe how the layout was obtained uses meaningful language. Instead of saying <i>"I used a force-directed approach to place the nodes."</i>, which does not help your audience relate to the network's structure, you can say <i>"I put all the sink nodes on this axis."</i>, which is immediately meaningful.

<h2>undirected networks</h2>
<p>The method works equally well on both directed and undirected networks (graphs). In undirected networks, edges don't have a direction and there is no distinction between sinks (nodes with in edges) and sources (nodes with out edges). In this case, the node degree (number of edges) can be used a in put to the mapping.

<p><img src="img/linnet-undirected-01.png" alt="Application of the linear layout for network visualization to an undirected network (graph).">

<h1>example</h1>

<p>A <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/04/28/0914771107.short">recent PNAS paper</a> [1], <i>Yan et al.</i> compared the <i>E. coli</i> gene regulatory network with that of the function calls in the Linux kernel. As you can see, the hairballs of these networks reveal no structural information. Other that the Linux network is larger, the hairballs offer no other information.

<img src="img/linnet-hairball-02.png">

<h2>original visualization</h2>

<p><i>Yan et al.</i> showed the networks with a parallel linear layout, shown below.

<img src="img/yan-et-al.png">

<p>Nodes on the axes were not ordered. Network edges between the top and bottom layer cross the middle layer axis and complicate the view. For example, it is not immediately obvious that there is almost no communication in the first two layers of the <i>E. coli</i> network.

<h2>hive plots</h2>

<p>The linear layouts cleraly demonstrate differences between these networks. For details about the linear layouts of these two networks, refer to slides in the <a href="talks/linnet-introduction.pdf">general introduction</a>.

<h1>applications</h1>

<h2>layered network</h2>

<p>Consider a network which contains multiple and independent layers of connections. How do the layers of connectivity relate?

<p><img src="img/linnet-matrix-01.png" alt="Application of the linear layout network visualization to layered networks.">

<p>By creating a hive plot in which the axis/position mapping is done using one layer, with edges of another layer drawn, correlation can be assessed visually.

<p><img src="img/linnet-matrix-02.png" alt="Application of hive plots (linear layout network visualization) to layered networks.">

<h1>only for networks?</h1>

<p>No.

<p>Hive plots can be applied to data structures other than networks. Fundamentally, the method requires that your data structure can be mapped onto a set of pairwise relationships. The objects of each pair can be network nodes, but they can also be an interval or spatial position. 

<p>The power of the method is realized when you can classify your objects (e.g. assign them to an axis) and, for each object, compute a meaningful property (e.g. degree, to determine object position on the axis).

<p>One variation of the hive plot is a circularly composited stacked bar plot, as shown below. In this example (<a href="img/assembly-quality.png">hires</a>, <a href="img/assembly-quality.pdf">PDF</a>), each of the three axes support two bar plots (on either side). Adjacent bar plots between neighbouring axes are merged to demonstrate the relationship between corresponding parts of the plots. 

<p><a href="img/assembly-quality.png"><img src="img/assembly-quality-small.png" alt="Assessing genome assembly quality with a hive plot, which compares reads, assembly and reference."></a>

<p>The figure shows a visual recipe for assessing the quality of a genomic assembly. An assembly is composed of reads (bottom axis), which are assembled into contigs (right axis). Independently, a reference assembly (left axis) may exist and act as a comparator. Among others, this hive plot answers the following questions

<ul>
<li>what fraction of reads are unassembled? 20%
<li>what fraction of reads are unaligned to reference? 30%
<li>what fraction of reference has no read coverage? 2%
<li>what fraction of reference has no contig coverage? 15%
<li>what fraction of reference is constructed by contigs &lt; 200kb? 60%
<li>are there contigs &gt; 200kb? no.
<li>what fraction of contigs are unaligned to the reference? 20% 
<li>what fraction of the overall assembly is derived from k=27 assembly? 80%
</ul>


<p>The benefit of this stacked bar plot layout is that comparison is periodic and has visual weight. This approach is similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates">parallel coordinate plot</a>, except here the plot wraps around.
