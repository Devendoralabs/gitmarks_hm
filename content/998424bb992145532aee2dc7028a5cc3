<ul id="situations-carousel" class="jcarousel-skin-situations">
  <li>
	<p><strong>Give your fingers a break</strong><br />
	You need to get some pertinent, detailed information to someone quickly but you don't have time for the idle chit chat that would certainly follow if you called them. Typing it all out in a text message would just be agony! Instead just leave a quick voicemail and your fingers will thank you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
	<p><strong>Maximize your time</strong><br />
	You are working on a dozen different projects and have as many calls to return. Instead of being stuck on the phone with just one, leave each a voicemail with an update and you may just have enough time to enjoy Happy Hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
	<p><strong>Create the illusion of communication</strong><br />
	You maxed out your emergency credit card the first week of school. Your parents are looking for some answers. A text message isn't going to cut it but a voicemail would mean that you tried calling them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
	<p><strong>Let them know you care</strong><br />
	From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed, your days are hectic! Friends and family call you and leave messages and you never seem to have enough time to call them back. Now you can leave a sweet voicemail for each and the sound of your voice will surely brighten their day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
	<p><strong>Get your point across without interruption</strong><br />
	Upon your friend's recommendation, you decide to go to a resort in the Caribbean. What she neglects to mention is that it is under loud construction. Leave her a voicemail so she can hear the disdain in your voice and take an apologetic stance when she calls you back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
	<p><strong>Have your cake and eat it too</strong><br />
	You desperately need to call your girlfriend but she is a talker and you don't want to spend an hour on the phone with her because you would much rather watch the game with your buddies. Leave her a sweet voicemail and get a reprieve for the night.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
	<p><strong>Play the field more effectively</strong><br />
	You are dating quite a few people at the same time. You don't want to leave them all text messages because there is nothing romantic about that. But a nice voicemail to each would score you points.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
	<p><strong>Don't cause a ten car pile up</strong><br />
	You are in your car on your way home. Normally you would maneuver through traffic as you text message people creating a potential recipe for disaster. Instead just leave a few quick voicemails so you stay between the lines and out of the emergency room.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
	<p><strong>Just call to confirm</strong><br />
	You have several meetings scheduled for the afternoon. You want to call to confirm but you don't want to disturb them or give them the opportunity to reschedule. Being able to just leave them a voicemail is not only polite but advantageous.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
	<p><strong>Appease your family</strong><br />
	Your Aunt June sent you a sweater for your birthday. You need to call her to thank her but you don't want to listen to her go on and on about her recent hip replacement. Instead just leave her an appreciative voicemail that she can share with her bridge club.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
	<p><strong>Just tell your side of the story</strong><br />
	You just partied hard last night and going to work is just not on your radar today. You dread having to call your boss and answering any awkward questions he may have. Instead just leave him a simple voicemail letting him know that you won't be coming into work today.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
		<p><strong>Let them know that you didn't forget</strong><br />
You just remembered that it is your friend's birthday. You want to call her but it is really late and you don't know if she is still up. Don't take the chance that you might awake her from her beauty sleep. Instead just leave her a sweet voicemail.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
		<p><strong>Don't be a bother</strong><br />
You just gave an awesome pitch to a potential client. You want to call him and thank him for the opportunity but you know he is in another meeting and don't want to bother him. Leave him a voicemail and this personal touch may just tip the scales in your favor.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
		<p><strong>Buy yourself some time</strong><br />
You go to a week long convention for work in Las Vegas and blow $5,000 the first night at the roulette table. You need to call your wife and tell her why she should hold off on making the monthly mortgage payment. Her voicemail will be much more understanding than she will.</p>
  </li>
