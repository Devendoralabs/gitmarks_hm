      Venkman is the JavaScript debugger for Mozilla based browsers, such
      as Mozilla 1.x, Netscape 7.x, and Phoenix/Firebird.
      This page contains the latest Venkman news and development releases.
      Please see <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/">the main
      Venkman page</a> for more information, and
      <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/venkman/faq/venkman-faq.html">the Venkman FAQ</a>
      for answers to common questions.

    <h1>News...</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.fatcow.com/">FatCow Web Hosting</a> has provided a <a href="http://www.fatcow.com/edu/venkman-faq-be/">Belorussian translation of the FAQ</a>.
      <li>James Ross is working on creating a Venkman XPI that once again
       works on ANY version of Mozilla.  Check out
       <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=247507">bug #247507</a> and version 0.9.85 below.
      <li>Venkman is broken on the Firefox and Mozilla trunk, sorry.  There
       is a regression in the tree code caused by changes to the
       Mozilla/Firefox tree widget.  See
       <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=274082">bug 274082</a>
       for more information.
      <li>Trying to get Venkman working on Firefox?  If you're using
       Firefox 1.0, try Venkman 0.9.84.
      <li><b>Svend Tofte</b> has put together a comprehensive Venkman
        tutorial called
        ``<a href="http://www.svendtofte.com/code/learning_venkman/">Learning the JavaScript debugger Venkman</a>.''
        It leads you step-by-step through nearly all of the features in Venkman,
        and it's got lots of excellent screenshots to match the text.
        Plan to take a break and stretch in the middle though, it's a
        long one :)
      <li>Check out
        <a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/">Netscape Devedge</a>'s 
        new article,
      <a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/venkman/01/">Using Breakpoints in Venkman</a>.
      <li>Venkman now supports a tabbed view container, read the post titled

        ``<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mozilla.devel.jsdebugger/242">Venkman gets tabbed views</a>'' for more information.
      <li>I noticed this <a href="ms-venkman.html">pro-Venkman post</a> on
        a <b>Microsoft</b>&trade; usenet group the other day.  Funny thing is,
        it's not on my news server anymore.  Was it cancelled, or is this just
        a newsfeed hiccup?  The world may never know :)
      <li>Read about extending Venkman in this
        <a href="http://news.gmane.org/thread.php?group=gmane.comp.mozilla.devel.jsdebugger">netscape.public.mozilla.jsdebugger</a> post titled

    <p>
      Click the one of the links in the <b>install</b> column
      to install Venkman using XPInstall.  These XPIs <b>WILL</b> work in
      <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/7/default.jsp">Netscape 7.x</a>!
    <p>
      Note that these installs need to write to your Mozilla install directory,
      which means <b>you</b> need to have <b>write access</b> to this directory.
      If you are on a unixish system and installed your browser
      via your package management system, you'll need to be <b>root</b>.
