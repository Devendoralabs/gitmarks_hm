Hi! I'm Tiger Cat, a very friendly female Maine Coon mix. Terry adopted me
on Saturday, March 24th, 2007 and I'm settling into my new home.
<p>
Here are some pictures of me. I'm sure there will be more as soon as I've
investi"cat"ed the whole house.

Here I am at the vet, waiting and hoping for a new home. Aren't I the sweetest?

<P>
When my new human opened my carrier door, I didn't want to come out for a
while, since where I used to live I had two other cats and two dogs to share
the house with, and I didn't know if my new human had any other pets.
<p>
After I while, I sneaked out of the carrier and went to the far corner of
the house, down the steps to the basement. My coloring makes me invisible in
here, doesn't it?

<P>
After letting me acclimate for a while, my new human told me I was being a
very silly cat for trying to hide in a radiator, and took this picture of
me to prove it.

<IMG SRC="6F5S5685-s.jpg" ALT="[Exploring]"></A>
<P>
Since I didn't hear any other animal sounds, I started exploring. Here I am
coming back up the steps. This is a <i>big</i> house to explore!

<P>
Here I am on Terry's bed, investigating. He kept taking flash pictures of
me, so I ducked for this shot!

<P>
Here I am on Tuesday, 3 days after moving in to my new house. I like to sit
on the bed and knead the bedspread. I also like to cuddle and be petted and
get chin scritches from Terry. I think this is going to work out well!
<p>
I'm also comfortable enough in my new home now that I can run like a maniac
from room to room when I feel like it, and run off to investigate any new
sounds that might be interesting (when I first got here, noises scared me).
<P>
Terry tells me "I can have all the mice I can catch", but I think he's kidding.
The only things I've "caught" so far are his toes when he wiggles them under 
the bedspread. What a fun game!
