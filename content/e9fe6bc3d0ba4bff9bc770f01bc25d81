  <p><em>Thanks to current and  former ETBD tour guides Joan Robinson, Ann Neel, and others for the following tips. </em></p>
  
  
  <p><strong>If you're not going to wear it more than three times, don't pack it! </strong>Every  piece of clothing you bring should complement every other item or have at least  two uses (e.g., sandals double as slippers, a scarf as a shoulder wrap).</p>
  <p><strong>Shop selectively:</strong> It's worth splurging a little to get just the  right clothes for your trip. For durable, lightweight travel clothes, consider  <a href="http://www.exofficio.com" target="_blank">Ex Officio</a> (www.exofficio.com, tel. 800-644-7303), <a href="http://www.travelsmith.com" target="_blank">TravelSmith</a>  (tel. 800-770-3387), <a href="http://www.tilley.com" target="_blank">Tilley Endurables</a> (tel. 800-363-8737), and <a href="http://www.rei.com" target="_blank">REI</a> (tel. 800-426-4840). In general, the  color black dresses up easily and can be extremely versatile.</p>
  <p><strong>Tops: </strong>Bring two or three T-shirts (or buy overseas), one or two  short-sleeved blouses, and one or two long-sleeved shirts. Long-sleeved shirts  with sleeves that roll up can double as short-sleeved shirts. Look for a  wrinkle-camouflaging pattern or blended fabrics that show a minimum of  wrinkles. Poly-blend fabric (such as Coolmax) will often dry overnight.  Washable silk also dries quickly and is lightweight.</p>
  <p><strong>Pants and shorts: </strong>Dark-colored pants don't show dirt or wrinkles.  Get a pair with a loose-fitting waistband that accommodates a money belt (and  big Italian meals). Try the pants with the zip-off legs that convert to shorts.  These are especially functional in Italy, allowing you to cover up  inside churches and beat the heat outside. </p>
  <p>If you bring shorts, one  pair is probably enough, ideal for staying cool in a resort town or your hotel  room. Few European women wear shorts. To avoid stares, consider bringing a pair  of Capri pants instead. </p>
  <p><strong>Skirts: </strong>Some women bring one or two skirts because they're as cool  and breathable as shorts, but dressier. And skirts make life easier than pants  when you're faced with a squat toilet! A lightweight skirt made with a blended  fabric will pack compactly. Make sure it has a comfy  waistband or  drawstring. Tilley (listed above) makes expensive but great skirts (and other  items) from blended fabric that feels like cotton. Skirts go with everything,  and can easily be dressed up or down.</p>
  <p><strong>Shoes: </strong>Bring one pair of comfortable walking shoes. Mephisto,  Ecco, and Rieker look dressier and more European than sneakers but are still  comfortable. For a second pair, consider sandals or Tevas in summer, or dark  leather flats in winter (can be worn with opaque hose and a skirt to dress up).  Before you leave home, walk several miles in any footwear you'll be taking to  be sure they're broken in.</p>
  <p><strong>Socks, underwear, pajamas, and swimsuit: </strong>Cotton/nylon-blend  socks dry faster than 100-percent cotton, which loses its softness when  air-dried. Try silk, microfiber, or stretch lace underwear, which dry  faster than all-cotton, but breathe more than nylon. Bring at least two bras (what  if you leave one hanging over your shower rail by accident?). A sports bra can  double as a hiking/sunning top. Shorts or lightweight pajama bottoms with a  T-shirt will get you modestly to the bathroom down the hall. You don't need a  bikini to try sunbathing topless on European beaches &mdash; local women with  one-piece bathing suits just roll down the top.</p>
  <p><strong>Jacket: </strong>Neutral colors (black, beige, navy) used to look more European than  bright colors, but now everything from azure blue to pumpkin orange has made its way into European wardrobes. If your waterproof jacket doesn't have a hood, take a  mini-umbrella or buy one in Europe. These are  easy to find &mdash; umbrella vendors, like worms, appear with the rain.</p>
  <p><strong>Weather-specific variations: </strong>In cold weather, silk long johns are great for  layering, weigh next to nothing, and dry quickly. Bring gloves and some kind of  warm hat for winter. If you're fair-skinned or prone to sunburn, bring a light,  crushable, wide-brimmed hat for sunny days. Wear shoes that are water-resistant  or waterproof.</p>
  <p><strong>Toiletries: </strong>All feminine products (even many of the same brands)  are sold throughout Europe, but it's easier to figure out how many tampons,  pads, or panty shields you'll need and bring them with you rather than having  to buy a too-small or too-large box in Europe. If you bring birth control pills  (or any timed-dosage prescription), take the time difference into account. If  you usually take a pill with breakfast, take it with lunch or dinner in Europe. Remember to carry the pills onto the plane each  way to take at your home-dosage time, too.</p>
  <p><strong>Accessorize, accessorize: </strong>Scarves give your limited wardrobe just the  color it needs. They dress up your outfit, are lightweight and easy to pack,  and, if purchased in Europe, make a great  souvenir. Some women bring a shawl-size scarf (often a fine cashmere wool version  called a pashmina) to  function as a sweater substitute, scarf, head wrap, or even a blanket on a  train. Functional, cheap, but beautiful imitation pashminas can be found all over Europe if you forget yours. Sleeveless vests and button-up cardigans can be worn alone or  mixed-and-matched with other clothes to give you several different looks as  well as layers for cold weather. Most women feel safe wearing  engagement/wedding rings while traveling, but leave other valuable or flashy  jewelry at home. A few pairs of inexpensive earrings are fun to bring. Remember  that your most important accessory is your hidden money belt.</p>
