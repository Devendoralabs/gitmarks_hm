	<h3><a href="?entry=801">Transform Tool 2 Updates</a></h3>
	<p class="info">Posted December 07, 2010 by senocular</p>
	<div class="body">The new revision of the Transform Tool is still a work in progress.  The tool is still in beta but now updates - including new source code - will be made available through a new <a href="/flash/tutorials/transformtool/">tutorial page</a>.  Feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> with comments or suggestions.<br /><br />I can't say that a lot of progress will be quickly, especially since the holidays are arriving, but I wanted to make sure what I had was made available publicly.</div>

	<h3><a href="?entry=800">Flash Player 10.2 Beta - More Version Confusion</a></h3>
	<p class="info">Posted December 03, 2010 by senocular</p>
	<div class="body">If you haven't already heard, A <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/">beta version of Flash Player 10.2</a> is now available from <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/">Adobe Labs</a>.  New features include enhanced video performance, support for IE 9, custom cursors (which I'm most excited about), and enhanced full screen.  More information about the release can be found in the labs site and I'm sure in the many other posts around the web that covered this.<br /><br />What I'd like to address is something else that's new with this release that you might not pick up on at first: the SWF version update.  To use new features in 10.2, you have to publish a SWF to target "Flash Player 11", or more accurately, give the SWF a SWF version of 11 (SWF11). This marks the first time that the <i>Target Player Version</i>, or SWF version, no longer matches the Flash Player version of the player with which it is associated.  So while the SWF version moves up to 11, Flash Player remains in 10, instead moving up to a new dot-release of 10.2.</div>

	<h3><a href="?entry=799">Transform Tool 2 (Beta)</a></h3>
	<p class="info">Posted November 17, 2010 by senocular</p>
	<div class="body"><img src="/images/2010/transformtool2beta.png" alt="Transform Tool" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;margin-bottom:5px" />For a while now, I've been slowly working on a successor to my original ActionScript 3 Transform Tool.  The code for that original version was a little hacky and if nothing else, complicated and confusing.<br/><br/>Even though it looks the same, this new version greatly improves on the old.  In fact, it was written from the ground up to be more modular, easier to understand and, hopefully, easier to use.<br/><br/>This new version is currently in beta; there are a few minor issues I'd still like to work out, but it is, in its current state, very usable.  For now, I will provide it simply as a self-contained download with a basic (Flash CS4) usage sample.<ul><li><a href="/demo/TransformToolAS3/TransformTool2Beta_2010-11-17.zip">Transform Tool 2 Beta</a></li></ul>Expect more information and an update sometime in the future (when I have time).</div>

	<h3><a href="?entry=798">ActionScript 3.0 Documentation Hole: LoaderInfo SecurityErrorEvent</a></h3>
	<p class="info">Posted November 11, 2010 by senocular</p>
	<div class="body">As mentioned in the recent <a href="/flash/tutorials/contentdomains/">Security Domains, Application Domains, and More in ActionScript 3.0</a> tutorial, you have the ability to load SWFs from another domain into your own SWF's security domain when using the Loader class.  What wasn't covered was error handling, or specifically, what happens when this fails.  In fact, I'll tell you now: a <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/events/SecurityErrorEvent.html#SECURITY_ERROR">SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR</a> event occurs.  This gets dispatched from the Loader's contentLoaderInfo object (a LoaderInfo instance) when a cross-domain policy file does not allow, or does not exist to allow the loading of a cross-domain SWF into the security domain of your SWF.  Currently (at least at the time of this writing), however, this is <b>not</b> documented in the <a href="http://adobe.com/go/as3lr">AS3 language reference</a>. <br/><br/>So, the next time you add listeners to your LoaderInfo, to be completely covered, make sure you also include one for SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR (though this would only be likely ever to occur if you were messing with security domains which is an unlikely case, nevertheless, you've been warned).</div>

	<h3><a href="?entry=797">Part 2: Security Domains, Application Domains, and More in ActionScript 3.0</a></h3>
	<p class="info">Posted October 28, 2010 by senocular</p>
	<div class="body"><a href="/flash/tutorials/contentdomains/?page=2">Part 2</a> is now up. Whereas part 1 covered security domains, this second, and final portion of the tutorial covers <a href="/flash/tutorials/contentdomains/?page=2#ApplicationDomains">application domains</a>. I don't think I'm quite as comfortable with the explanations in this half of the tutorial, but at least its a good few pages shorter than the security half.  Also, when writing the portion covering <a href="/flash/tutorials/contentdomains/?page=2#SameDomainRuntimeSharedLibraries">runtime shared libraries</a>, I didn't realize that as of CS5, Flash Pro also started including some framework additions to make dealing with the process a little easier (namely preloading).  With Flash and Flex both doing a lot of the heavy work for you there, some of the lower level details maybe aren't so important anymore? Though, in the end, I guess it doesn't hurt to know a little of what's going on under the hood.<p>Enjoy!</p></div>

	<h3><a href="?entry=796">Part 1: Security Domains, Application Domains, and More in ActionScript 3.0</a></h3>
	<p class="info">Posted October 23, 2010 by senocular</p>
	<div class="body">I've just posted part 1 of a new Flash tutorial: <a href="/flash/tutorials/contentdomains/">Security Domains, Application Domains, and More in ActionScript 3.0</a>. Part 1 covers security domains and all that jazz while part 2 (still being written) will cover application domains.  The security domain portion is probably a little less exciting, but no less important.  I'm not happy with how long it is (15 pages printed); after all, no one <i>actually</i> likes to read.  But I think a lot of important topics are covered and it should serve as a pretty good resource for this stuff later on.  I hope to have part 2 done in the next week or so.</div>

	<h3><a href="?entry=793">Flash Player 1.0 Released for Desktop!</a></h3>
	<p class="info">Posted June 11, 2010 by senocular</p>
	<div class="body"><p>As you've probably already heard, <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Flash Player</a> 1.0 - err, 10.1 - has recently been released (along with <a href="http://get.adobe.com/air/">AIR 2.0</a>) for desktop platforms, Windows, Mac, and Linux.  It's been a long, LONG, and grueling release for what has become nothing more than a dot release, in fact the first ever "real" dot release for Flash Player as it marks the first time a Flash Player version has had a number other than 0 in it's minor version value.  Why not Flash Player 11?  Afterall, A new <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/">Creative Suite</a> was just launched, wouldn't it make sense?  Normally, it would, but Flash Player has been out of sync, in terms of development, with the creative suite for a while now, and is more or less on it's own.  Additionally, this release has been more of a maintenance release - a very large one, which is why I'm calling it Flash Player 1.0.</p></div>
