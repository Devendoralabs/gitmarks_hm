			<p>Confide is a Facebook application about you and your relationship towards your friends. You can describe your feelings towards your friends and control, at the same time, whether they can view your feelings towards them or not, or even under what conditions they can view it. This can lead to scenarios such as :</p>
<p>- Alice and Bob have a crush on each other but they don&#8217;t know about the mutuality of their feelings.<br />
- Alice uses Confide, and sets her feelings towards Bob as &#8220;I love Bob&#8221;, but setting the application to reveal this to Bob only if Bob&#8217;s feelings towards Alice are close.<br />
- Bob, knowing nothing, uses Confide and sets his feelings towards Alice as &#8220;I love Alice&#8221;.<br />
- Both Alice and Bob are notified of their mutual feelings, and love blooms~</p>
<p>Confide also features a Confide Wall, which lets you choose the visibility of your messages (Public, private, anonymous, visible to recipient only, visible to recipient only if he/she loves me, etc.). This wall can also be shown on your profile.<br />

			<p>Spare Change is designed to help users and developers buy and sell goods and services online securely and easily.</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.facebook.com/sparechange" rel="nofollow">http://apps.facebook.com/sparechange</a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve all built some amazing applications, from games, to gifting, to social sharing. Now there is a new way to monetize these great applications. Why not have a user pay $0.50 for an extra special gift and message, pay a $1 monthly subscription for playing premium games, or pay $0.25 to see how one has as been rated by friends?</p>
<p>Spare Change allows you, the developer, to charge small amounts of money which was previously both uneconomic al and too hard for users to use. We&#8217;ve built a 1-click interface which keeps users on your applications and allows them to purchase content with ease and confidence.</p>
<p>My team and I have over 15 years of building enterprise grade financial services applications and we think you&#8217;ll like the product we&#8217;ve built. It&#8217;s simple, reliable, and scalable. We&#8217;re committed to building the best payment solution for social networking.</p>
<p>Please take a look, experiment with your apps, let us know what you think &#8211; we&#8217;re at your service.</p>
<p>Spare Change &#8211; the way to pay for the little stuff.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;Buddy Truth or Dare&#8221; application revolves around a simulation of the game &#8220;Truth or Dare&#8221;. Users would initiate a game of Truth or Dare by sending a notification request that simply says &#8220;Truth or Dare?&#8221;. The friend would select either Truth or Dare and the user would receive a notification of what their friend selected. </p>
<p>If the friend selects Truth, the user would send the friend a question, to which they must tell the truth! </p>
<p>If the friend selects Dare, the user would send the friend a dare that they must do and send evidence back to the friend proving that they did it. If the friend doesn&#8217;t do the dare then the user is able to send a virtual &#8220;jab&#8221; to their friend for not doing the dare.</p>

			<p>Our application doesn&#8217;t do anything especially earthshaking or awe-inspiring like some of the other descriptions above. But of the seven so called **Bingo** applications in facebook, it is arguably the only one that is truly Bingo as tens of millions of users know it. </p>
<p>It is multiplayer, has chat, integrates facebook images, news feeds and our players typically stay and play for an 2 hours or more each day. Out on our website, we have advanced versions that show youtube videos in the intermission, as well as versions that have web streaming between camera enabled users.</p>
<p>you can see the facebook version here http:/apps.facebook.com/bingowin</p>
<p>or the more versions of the similar application over here <a href="http://www.win365bingo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.win365bingo.com</a></p>

<p>You! Vampire allows facebook users to select photographs and then automatically apply vampire transformations to them with no human input.</p>
<p>The more people you transform, the more powerful you become and more transformations will become available. Transformations will also change over time.</p>
<p>People would want to use this application to have some fun and see what friends look like as vampires.</p>

			<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>Have a look at mixpixx, a new Facebook app that makes a picture collage of your friend&#8217;s Facebook profile images.  You can create multiple collages and divide your friends into groups.  </p>
<p>The technology behind mixpixx was developed by FXPal, a joint venture between Fuji Films of Japan and Xerox.  mixpixx works by automatically detecting the location of a face in an image by using color and texture. The technique is called“StainedGlass” because the resulting collage with irregular shapes is reminiscent of a stained glass window. The collages can be printed, included in Web pages, or shared via email. </p>
<p>Check it out:<br />

			<p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>TAMBA have recently launched the first of a series of Facebook widgets for mydeco, a customisable interior design website that lets users plan their own room designs using 3D models, created by the founders of lastminute.com. </p>
<p>In the first Facebook widget, Facebook users can create their dream dinner party, using a mix of famous and fictional characters as well as their own Facebook friends. They can then invite friends to the party and those friends can change the seating arrangements or invite their own preferred guests. You can even get your mates to rate your dinner party.</p>

			<p>My name is nathan stobezki. I am currently 23 years of age and about to graduate college. Around 2 weeks ago i was kicked off from facebook. My account was disabled, pictures gone, wall gone, name gone it is as if i have not existed. And now i am fighting to get my facebook back. I personally think this is something that should be scrutized a little more and that swift action should be taken and justice should be served. Below is a blog soemone wrote about this whole college students getting kicked off from facebook And it was beautifully written by Tim Sally:</p>
<p>Robert Scoble recently wrote on his popular blog, Scobleizer, a post about someone getting kicked off of Facebook. Nathan Stobezki’s situation clearly highlights what will become a pressing issue for a new generation of Web 2.0 enthusiasts. For those who cannot listen to the audio, Nathan Stobezki was the administer of several groups on Facebook. His problems started when he sent out a message to all of his group members informing them of a fashion website that he runs. As a result of his messages, Stobezki began to receive friend requests from members of his groups. The volume of the friend requests resulted in Stobezki’s account getting flagged as a possible spam account and in the end his account was shut down with the words “this is a final decision”.<br />
This is a situation where a web entrepreneur attempting to establish a presence on the web was a victim of his own success. It is clear that Stobezki’s efforts to spread his ideas about fashion were successful– so successful in fact, that Facebook assumed that the traffic only could have been generated through illicit means. The possibility that Stobezki did employ spam techniques is possible; I claim it is not probable. Consider the likely possibility that Stobezki’s efforts were legitimate: what Facebook is doing is making it impossible for ambitious individuals to honestly grow and spread their ideas and businesses on the web.<br />
In a Web 2.0 age, Facebook accounts need to be treated with the significance that they deserve. They are much more then a simple personal profile; for many, Facebook accounts are ways to find jobs and promote personal businesses. Stobezki lost many hours of labor that he put into growing his groups and he potentially lost a significant amount of traffic and presence for his website. Both of these are very real losses for someone trying to establish his/her own website.</p>
<p>Facebook has the civic responsibility to adjust their policies to make them more inline with the userbase. It is a powerful tool that puts power in the hands of the people, however, this tool is useless if it can be undermined at any second by the Facebook administrators. Facebook must accept the fact that it is no longer a simple social network: it is a network much like the real world where people conduct business, trade goods, and share ideas.</p>
<p>If you would like to contact me you can call me at 917-494-7228</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Nathan Stobezki</p>

<p>* Short description: aerobis is a new approach to sport training and tracking that works across community boundaries. In the first iteration it´s a sport route planer that lets users create, edit and discover routes all over the globe.</p>
<p>* Impact: aerobis is fully integrated into Facebook and Users can start to create or discover routes in an instant. The route planer uses the most advanced techniques to display sport routes. It doesn´t display result lists or &#8216;show me routes 5k/10k/&#8230; from point x&#8217; type of filters &#8211; instead it displays all routes over the globe. Users can interactively explore them by zooming and panning the map. It runs on Mozilla, Safari and Internet Explorer. No plugins (apart from some flash for the elevation graph). No GPS needed.</p>
<p>* Future: We are just getting started and already deliver more value than our competition in that area. The next release will include the most dedicated Training planer &amp; tracker available online. It will be working in tight integration with the route planer, making it easy to set up public training events or track your training and measure your results.</p>

			<p>I am looking to rank everyone&#8217;s popularity in Facebook, and when it comes down to it, its all about how many friends you have. You can submit yourself to the rankings and search through them to see where everyone else ranks. The question is, how many friends do you have?</p>

			<p>Job Matching Site itzbig Targets Quiet Working Professionals with an Application that is Fun and Offers the Potential of a Real Vacation and More to Those Who Use It </p>
<p>Virtual VayCay is a new Facebook application that lets users send their friends in dead-end jobs on a virtual vacation. Itzbig started this idea, which it says can reach highly qualified individuals who are currently employed in unfulfilling positions but are reluctant to pursue other career opportunities because of concerns over privacy and the lack of immediate feedback. With virtual VayCay, itzbig says users can create anonymous profiles based upon their skills and desires. They then see in real time how they score against these opportunities. </p>

<p>Not a Facebook app but a cool little tool for coming up with witty status updates when your brain is too fried to think of anything suitably funny yourself.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think it would really work as a Facebook app, but if there is sufficient demand then maybe one could be added.</p>

			<p>We have recently launched a fun poking application. Called my front door. unlike any other poking application, where the action was from the &#8216;POKER&#8217; and usually generated at their end, this app focuses on leaving a foot print on the profile of the &#8216;POKEE&#8217; (for lack of a better word).<br />
While one of the most popular activities on FB still remain visiting each other&#8217;s profile&#8217;s, we thought this could act as your door to Facebook life, where one could leave messages (pokes), of multiple kinds while browsing through their friends profiles. In essence it says &#8216;Hey i was here, dropped in to say hi and check on what&#8217;s new&#8217;, thus leaving a footprint.</p>
<p>It is just a fun application.<br />

<p>This application is the beginnings of what we feel will be a new movement that allows facebook users to leverage their collective opinions to create change in the real world marketplace.  Of course, this all starts out as just a fun app with cool avatars, but there are a lot of great ideas in store.</p>

			<p>Hellooooo!!!!</p>
<p> I am working with a very special project called &#8220;Costume Studio&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Just so u get the gist and fall in love with the project&#8230;its  being put together by an Organic Fair trade denim line called &#8220;Good Society&#8221; . </p>
<p>We are selling costumes, and then donating all the money!!!  Donating 100% of  the proceeds to several different charities. I am attaching the scoop on the project, and the denim line&#8230;Maybe you may know who to send this over to, to get some press? Or maybe u can direct me as to where to dig! Maybe someone you know would be interested in being a part of the project/ for example we are hoping to film natalie portman rapping a video in a costume(unconfirmed <img src='http://www.insidefacebook.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> ), and several big bands doing the same!</p>
<p>Also, several well known fashion designers are designing peices to go on auction on the website. To say the least I am soo excited, and hope u can be a part. I need All sorts of people&#8230;</p>
<p>Find us on the Web</p>

			<p>please listen to your users! the new facebook is a REALLY BAD IDEA. please don&#8217;t force us to use it. Among the reasons already stated, i do not like the fact that it looks like Myspace, and as i already have a slowish computer/internet, the increasced CPU usage will make it EVEN MORE DIFFICULT to use. to state it in plain english&#8230;THE NEW FACEBOOK SUCKS. PUT IT BACK TO THE OLD LAYOUT.</p>

			<p>tip: dont change to the new facebook it is more cluttered then the old with all of the tabs. People dont understand it and want the simple old design where the know where everything is and dont have to click on like 50 different things. We want our walls, and super pokes, and our bumper stickers, but we dont want is all of these tabs and crap&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..just take a look at some of the groups facebook 1,000,000+ people against the new design maybe u should listen&#8230;</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>On the new Facebook when my profile page is first opened, the wall tab is automatically displayed by default. Is there anyway to make the info tab the &#8216;main tab&#8217; so to speak. So that when people visit my profile the first thing they see is the info tab, they can then choose to navigate to my wall, photos or boxes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that when I visit some peoples pages, the Info tab appears by default. Can it be set this way or is Facebook just behaving abit randomly. </p>
<p>Hope to hear from you soon,</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

			<p>Sunny -</p>
<p>From what I understand if you navigate to the page of someone who is already your friend you will see their wall first.  On the otherhand if you navigate to the page of someone who is not your friend you see the Info tab first.  As far as I know you cannot alter this behavior, but I haven&#8217;t searched too much.</p>

			<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I wanted to share my application &#8220;Accurate Salary Search&#8221; engine for Facebook. </p>
<p>Accurate salary search is a salary search engine based on data published by Department of Labor under freedom of information act. This data is composed of H1B filings and Green Card filing for PERM applications.<br />
These are real jobs and salary which were disclosed by companies to DOL as a part of regulatory requirements and each record indicates one job offered by the company.<br />
Accurate Salary Search has indexed close to a million jobs current and would eventually have more than 5 million jobs to search from.</p>

			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I wanted to share an application called SkoolPool (facebook link &#8211; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/d7rnk2)" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/d7rnk2)</a>.  SkoolPool allows students to keep an up-to-date display of the schools they are considering. It helps them organize their school decision, and more importantly shares their choices with other friends that are Facebook or MySpace members easily. The application is available on Facebook and MySpace and they are both connected to <a href="http://www.skoolpool.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.skoolpool.com</a>, the hub for all interactions. Because they are all linked together through the .com hub all interactions are shared across the networks. If a user comments on school X on their MySpace page it shows up on the .com and the Facebook application.</p>
<p>SkoolPool provides colleges and universities with the ability to manage their entire social portfolio from one location thereby maintaining a consistent message/”brand” across multiple platforms.  It will also automatically pull new content from their website and, through the “Message” function, notify them of new content.</p>
<p>SkoolPool’s dash¬board analytics for colleges and universities provides trend-based applicant data that lets them see:<br />
•  Number of prospective students considering their school and their basic demographic data<br />
•  The consideration set of their prospective students<br />
•  Preference rankings and trends over time<br />
•  Reasons why students are considering the institution, and who the applicant identifies as key competitors<br />
•  Conversion rate of prospects to applicants for the college/university and key competitors, and timing of that conversion<br />
•  Timing of the college/university&#8217;s offers and those of their key competitors<br />
•  Scholarship offers compared to key competitors </p>
<p>If you have more questions I would welcome the chance to speak with you further.  Thanks for looking!</p>
<p>Best,<br />
Seth</p>

			<p>How to Transfer Facebook Friends Birthdays or Events to Outlook and your iPhone / Mobile Device</p>
<p>Option 1 for Exporting Facebook Events:</p>
<p>(NOTE: You can also use the &#8220;Export Events&#8221; link on the Facebook events screen, but it does not give you a choice of the type of event you want to export. It also still produces an ICS file that you will need to import into SunBird Calendar, unless you have Outlook 2007 or newer.</p>
<p>=================================================<br />
Option 1 for Exporting Facebook Friends Birthdays:</p>
<p>(NOTE: You can also use the &#8220;Birthdays&#8221; link on the Facebook with the Birthday Exporter,  It also still produces an ICS file that you </p>
<p>will need to import into SunBird Calendar, unless you have Outlook 2007 or newer.<br />

<p>=================================================<br />
Option 2 for Exporting Facebook Friends Birthdays &amp; Events:</p>
<p>* Add the Facebook Calendar App to your facebook, it is good for facilitating your ability to extract the birthdays of everyone in </p>
<p>your Facebook and Facebook events to a file for uploading into Outlook and syncing to the calendar on your mobile device, in my case the iPhone. </p>
<p><a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fbcalendar" rel="nofollow">http://apps.facebook.com/fbcalendar</a> (Facebook Calendar App you need to install)</p>
<p>*  During the install, choose &#8220;Allow Offline Access&#8221;<br />
*  Click on &#8220;Get Your Calendars Now&#8221; button<br />
*  (Note to get future extracts you will want to Bookmark this app in Facebook once you install it)</p>
<p>(Facebook Birthdays) (From within the Facebook Calendar App)</p>
<p>*  To Sync birthdays, you must actually download them to a file so go to the &#8220;Subscribe to your friends&#8217; Birthday&#8221; section on the page and click on &#8220;download a copy here&#8221;  link under the Birthday section.<br />
*  Save this birthday ICS file to your hard drive and make a note of the directory you saved it in, you will need to know this.</p>
<p>(Facebook Events)  (From within the Facebook Calendar App)<br />
*  To Sync events, you must actually download them to a file so go to the &#8220;Subscribe to your Facebook events&#8221; section on the page and click on &#8220;download a copy here&#8221; link under the Events section.<br />
* Choose the type of events you want to export by using the &#8220;Choose which events to export&#8221; dropdown box before clicking on the download file link<br />
*  Save this events ICS file to your hard drive and make a note of the directory you saved it in, you will need to know this.<br />
======================================================<br />
Required Additional Steps for Options 1 or 2 above for non Outlook 2007 users:</p>
<p>Now you need to import this ICS file into Mozilla Sunbird Calendar (a free Calender application)<br />
You will need to install this free calendar application to your computer<br />
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/</a> (download Sunbird URL)</p>
<p>(NOTE: If you have Outlook 2007 or newer, you do not need the Mozilla Sunbird steps below, you are able to import the ICS file directly into outlook, however if you have an outlook older then the 2007 version, you must use the Sunbird Calendar extraction steps below to create an facebook events or birthday file you can import into Outlook.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Install Mozilla Sunbird and once installed, do the following to import Facebook events or Facebook friends birthdays<br />
1. Go to &#8220;File&#8221; &amp; &#8220;New Calendar&#8221;, Choose &#8220;On my Computer&#8221;, click &#8220;Next&#8221;<br />
2. Name your Calender and click on &#8220;Next&#8221;, then click on &#8220;Finish&#8221;<br />
3. Now Go to &#8220;File&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Import&#8221;<br />
4. Use this file manager window to locate the downloaded Facebook ICS files for your events or birthdays &amp; click on &#8220;Open&#8221; once you find the file. You will have to import one file for Facebook events &amp; one file for Facebook birthdays, but you can import them to the </p>
<p>same Sunbird calender, so you will only need to export one file for importing into Outlook.<br />
5. Now you are ready to export all your Facebook friends birthdays and/or Facebook events to an Outlook CSV file.<br />
6. Now choose &#8220;File&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Export Calendar&#8221;<br />
7. A select calendar window will pop up an now select the calendar name that you imported your friends birthday to and click on &#8220;Ok&#8221;<br />
8. An &#8220;Export&#8221; window will appear and in &#8220;Save as type&#8221; box choose &#8220;Outlook Comma Separate Values (*.csv)<br />
9. Look at &#8220;File name&#8221; and make a note of this name as you will need this file for importing into Outlook, also right above the &#8220;File name&#8221; box is a little yellow folder and directory names, make a note of this as you this is where it is saving your exported CSV file, either accept the directory it is showing or change the location (using Browse Folders button) where it is saving your CSV file.<br />
10. Click on &#8220;Save&#8221;</p>
<p>============================================<br />
Steps for Importing Facebook Birthdays and/or Facebook Events CSV file into Outlook</p>
<p>1. Open your Outlook Calendar<br />
2. Choose &#8220;File&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Import&#8221;, then in the window Choose &#8220;Import from another program or file&#8221; &amp; click on &#8220;Next&#8221;<br />
3. Choose &#8220;Comma Separated Values (Windows)&#8221; in the window, then click on &#8220;Next&#8221;<br />
4. Now use the &#8220;Import a file&#8221; window to browse your hard drive to find the CSV file you just exported from the Sunbird Calendar.<br />
5. Once you locate your exported CSV file, Choose &#8220;Do not import duplicate items&#8221; &amp; Click on &#8220;Next&#8221;<br />
6. A new &#8220;Import a File&#8221; window will appear and now choose the Outlook calendar that you want to import your Facebook events and/or birthdays to.<br />
7. Click on &#8220;Next&#8221;<br />
8. A new &#8220;Import a File&#8221; windows will appear, but you should not need to alter the field mappings, so just click on &#8220;Finish&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s It!<br />
Now just sync your Outlook with your iPhone or other mobile device and your Facebook Events and/or Facebook Friends Birthdays will now be on your iPhone or other mobile device.</p>

I have the invision of one day being able to help the world in security and the well being of families. Perhaps this will take great effort but im working hard for it,I recently have buisness and research being conducted in Sale Lake City UT and Florida the posibilities of such product to help and give some back. Social Networks are very facinating being able to communicate with mass quantities of people all over the world gives you instant feed back on what they think what should be done and thier personal opinions on how they think society will interact in a world of new technology. with change comes skeptizisim and some times fear as well as greatness and innovative. Mark you have a great team and people expect greatness, thats the reason for this message.

			<p>Two apps from the legal space, specifically: from JD Supra, a site that offers free legal information for anyone.</p>
<p>JD Supra allows lawyers, law firms, and other legal professionals to post their legal documents (alerts, articles, briefs, newsletters, filings) online. The work is gathered in an online portfolio, but also is available in Search (via JDSupra.com and Google, etc.)</p>
<p>1. JD Supra Docs<br />
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=26217609291" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=26217609291</a><br />
Allows any contributor to stream their own portfolio from JD Supra to a Facebook profile or page. Appears as a &#8220;Documents&#8221; tab and as a box, and any activity on JD Supra (ie, new doc uploads) appears in the news stream in Facebook.</p>
<p>2. JD Supra Legal News<br />
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=62496313536" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=62496313536</a><br />
Allows anyone to stream legal information by subject from JD Supra to Facebook profiles or pages. All of the work on JD Supra is available by subject stream: Securities Law, IP Law, Tech Law, Tax Law, Employment Law, you name it. While JD Supra Docs allows any given professional to connect *their* work between the two platforms, Legal News allows you to stream all of it, by subject&#8230;</p>

			<p>I keep getting warnings on my site. FACEBOOK keeps sending me friend suggestions then when I click on them&#8211;I get a warning! What is that all about! My daughter&#8217;s account (Jessica Runquist), was disabled a few days ago too&#8211;and she does not know why. People have been raving to me about how fun FACEBOOK is?! What are they talking about? I cannot even connect with friends and family because I keep getting warnings. Well here is yours: DO NOT send me anymore friend suggestions! You annoy me when I click on them, and I get a warning! I am also annoyed that you disabled the account of my autistic daughter! It is hard enough for her to communicate and make friends&#8211;then you go and do that to her! Who is running the show here? Where are your parents?!</p>

			<p>Pixelmatic has launched the Gamerbook application! Gamerbook is an application designed to connect gamers on Facebook. You can add it<br />
here: <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/gamerbook" rel="nofollow">http://apps.facebook.com/gamerbook</a></p>
<p>“We see Gamerbook as an extension of Facebook – an embedded social network within Facebook built specifically for gamers,” said Samson Mow, founder and director, Pixelmatic Entertainment. “We envision that Gamerbook will reconnect gamers much in the same way that school and work networks on Facebook bring together classmates and coworkers.”</p>
<p>About Gamerbook</p>
<p>Developed by Pixelmatic Entertainment, Gamerbook is an application designed to connect gamers on the Facebook platform. Users of Gamerbook can create profiles for different games which detail their nickname, which servers they played on, their faction and clan, and the time period for which they played that game; this information is then easily searchable by any other Gamerbook user. With Gamerbook, users will be able to find people they have played with in the past that are known only by an alias. Gamerbook also allows gamers to notify friends about the games they are currently playing, as well as keep track of the gaming aliases of friends.</p>
<p>About Pixelmatic Entertainment</p>
<p>Pixelmatic Entertainment is a developer of social network applications and online games. Founded in 2008, Pixelmatic Entertainment is a privately held company headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. The founding team at Pixelmatic is composed of former Activision Blizzard, THQ, and Electronic Arts developers.

			<p>Is there a way to track/receive wall comments via RSS?</p>
<p>We operate in a heavily regulated industry, and it creates some challenges to interacting with the public through Facebook.  One of the requirements is that we be able to archive all interactions (screen shots won&#8217;t work).  RSS feeds have provide the solution for Twitter, and are hoping they can do the same for Facebook.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

			<p>New to Facebook, </p>
<p>Was having problems with one of your game applications called Dragon Wars. Getting Errors and Try Agains resulting in negligable game results, and unable to access &#8220;Legendary Quests&#8221; without mid loading freezes. Unable to upload any picture at all, without my internet freezing up and kicking me off.</p>
<p>But you are not concerned with such a small problems as mine, it will most likely just be ignored like the rest of the comments I have seen in the &#8220;Facebook Help Center&#8221;.  I realize that this message won&#8217;t make it out either, because of its content.</p>
<p>I have been around for awhile, I was there when the internet was first introduced to the US Naval Base where I was working, I didn&#8217;t understand alot of it, but through the years, I begin to read between the lines.</p>
<p>This world, I see it clearly, if your the big guy, you are strong and powerful, you start out small, caring for the little people, but you get too big to care. </p>
<p>Maybe it was the move, that took all your time, and you haven&#8217;t been able to help the people out as much as you want, or maybe you get thousands or millions of problems like this everyday and you are burnt out, I can understand that, but you knew this could happen someday, and in knowing that, you should have been better prepared. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a perfect person, that Honor is given to Jesus and Jesus alone. No, I am just a nobody, that gets tired and burnt out of many things and one thing I am extremely burnt out on, is the lack of quality that I have seen on Facebook.</p>
<p>Its frustrating to people, when they don&#8217;t understand something, they feel helpless, because they don&#8217;t have the knowledge needed to fix the problem, but you all do, and if you don&#8217;t, you need to find the people that do and get them going on the problems at hand. </p>
<p>If you find that you don&#8217;t have enough money, then you shouldn&#8217;t be in this business. </p>
<p>People will go on accepting the problems and asking for help, because its in peoples nature to do so, thats just the way it is, thats reality. </p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if someone, stands up and breaks the chains of reality. Someone who stands up with Integrity, Dignity, Strength, Courage and Honor, and gives way to their own pride and abuse to those who have placed their Trust in them, to help.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice.</p>
<p>Sincerly Yours,<br />
Stephen Avent</p>

			<p>Looking at the Page Stats &#8211; all these SPAM Accounts in between the seroius ones &#8211; I am not looking forward (as an advertiser) to your upcoming online booking systems. Even by category count its often a mistery. A lot of accounts are visible one day but disapear the next. And the leaderboards: how come f.e. Cristiano Ronaldo stagnates 4 weeks (seems more reasonable) and suddenly on one day gains half a million fans???</p>

			<p>I was a member of Facebook, but will be deleting my account due to a rip off that Facebook did. I was charged a $10 fee and I wasn&#8217;t even told that would happen. I want my money back. If you are going to charge people a fee of any kind for doing anything on your site, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR to the person. THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING TELLING THAT PERSON. I expect to hear from you. If not I you will hear from my attorney.</p>

			<p>i got  this message on facebook and was wondering if it was true. </p>
<p>Facebook is becoming very slow. History shows that the reason is that there are too many non-active members of Facebook. We will send this message today around to see if members are active or not. When active, please forward this message to 15 other users using Copy-Paste to show that it is active. Who does not send this message within 2 weeks will be deleted without hesitation to make room.</p>
<p>thanks for your time. lee</p>

I have emailed several times and have gotten no response. What has happened and can I expect to be able to access it ever again? Please respond, getting no answer is very frustrating. Thank you</p>

			<p>I am on FB everyday but not able to log in since Saturday. it is saying Your account is temporarily unavailable due to site maintenance. It should be available again within a few hours. We apologize for the inconvenience. I have been trying to contact FB for days. I was told it was probably my internet service but after 3 hours onthe phone with them we found it is NOT So they told me to re-registar and when I try it tells me the email address already exists. What is happening here? How do I reach Facebook with this problem? Where do I pick up a reply? Thank you Clare~</p>
