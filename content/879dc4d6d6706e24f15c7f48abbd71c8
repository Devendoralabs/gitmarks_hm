<h1>Primary & Secondary Actions in Web Forms</h1>
<cite class='sub'><span class='right'>August 25, 2007</span><span>by <a href="http://www.lukew.com/about/">Luke Wroblewski</a> & <a href="http://www.etre/com">Etre</a></span></cite>

<p>In recent months, I&#8217;ve been working on refining the design recommendations 
          in my upcoming book, <a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/webforms/">Web 
          Form Design Best Practices</a>, through actual usage data. To that end, 
          I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with London-based usability firm 
          <a href="http://www.etre.com/">Etre</a> on several eye-tracking and 
          usability studies focused on specific aspects of Web form design. One 
          of these tests focused on the distinction between primary and secondary 
          actions.</p>
        <h2>Primary &amp; Secondary Actions</h2><p>
          A typical Web form usually enables several &#8220;final&#8221; actions. 
          Actions like &#8220;Submit&#8221;, &#8220;Save&#8221;, or &#8220;Continue&#8221; 
          are intended to enable form completion &#8211;the primary goal of just 
          about anyone who has started filling in a form. Because they enable 
          the most important action on the form (completion), they are often referred 
          to as primary actions.</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/img/PSactions_fig1.gif" alt="Typical Web Form" width="450" height="575" style="padding:8px 0px;"></p>
        <p>Secondary actions, on the other hand, tend to be less utilized and 
          most often allow people to retract the data they&#8217;ve entered. Options 
          like &#8220;Cancel&#8221;, &#8220;Reset&#8221;, or &#8220;Go Back&#8221; 
          represent secondary actions that are counter to most people&#8217;s 
          primary goal of completing the form they started.</p>
        <p>Because secondary actions can have negative consequences, especially 
          when used unintentionally, I&#8217;ve often argued they should be absent 
          from forms. Imagine filling in a long form online only to hit the &#8220;Reset&#8221; 
          button and have all your data erased.</p>
        <p>That said there are situations where secondary actions make sense (&#8220;Save 
          for later&#8221;, &#8220;Export&#8221;, etc.). In these conditions, 
          the best practice I&#8217;ve advocated has been to visually distinguish 
          primary and secondary actions so people have an clear path illuminating 
          their primary goal: completing a form.</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/img/PSactions_fig2.gif" alt="Visual Distinctions" width="450" height="401" style="padding:8px 0px;"></p>
        <p>Reducing the visual prominence of secondary actions minimizes the risk 
          for potential errors and further directs people toward a successful 
          outcome. But what&#8217;s the best way to accomplish this distinction? 
          How different should primary and secondary actions be and where should 
          they be placed? To answers these questions, Etre and I ran a few tests.</p>
        <p>In order to assess which presentation of primary and secondary actions 
          might work best, we tested six variations on 23 people using eye-tracking 
          and usability metrics. Participants were presented each of six designs 
          in random order (to minimize familiarity biases) and asked to &#8220;Please 
          complete the form fully and accurately&#8221;.</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/img/PSactions_fig3.gif" alt="Options Tested" width="450" height="800" style="padding:8px 0px;"></p>
        <h2>Visual Distinctions</h2><p>
          People accomplished their task perfectly when using five of the six 
          designs. Option A, B, C, D and F achieved success rates of 100%, without 
          causing users to make a single error. They also saw comparable task 
          completion times and received similarly high satisfaction ratings.</p>
        <p>Option B performed best of all. Fixations were shorter and fewer in 
          number when using this design. And people were also able to complete 
          the task more quickly and efficiently than they did when using the others.</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/img/PSactions_fig4.gif" alt="Option B: Fixations" width="450" height="604" style="padding:8px 0px;"></p>
        <p>However, when commenting on Option A, several people said that displaying 
          the &#8220;Cancel&#8221; option as a link was helpful. One person mentioned 
          that, while such a recessive presentation made this option harder to 
          find, it helped prevent accidental (and catastrophic) cancellations. 
          Another felt that &#8220;Submit&#8221; was the most important option 
          and thus thought it was logical that &#8220;Cancel&#8221; wasn&#8217;t 
          given equal status in the user interface.</p>
        <p>Several people also made positive comments about Option C&#8217;s grey 
          &#8220;Cancel&#8221; button. One participant said that its coloring 
          made it easier to spot &#8220;the right button&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;Submit&#8221;), 
          while another said that the different colored buttons &#8220;slow you 
          down [and] make you check that you are hitting on the right thing.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Interestingly, people required around eight more fixations to process 
          Option C than they did to process Option B &#8211; a design that presented 
          both options as near-identical green left-aligned buttons. It seems 
          that, while users liked they fact that the grey made Option C&#8217;s 
          &#8220;Cancel&#8221; button easier to spot, it did make the design less 
          efficient in terms of its ability to be processed quickly. That said, 
          when using Option B, a number of users expressed concern that they &#8220;could 
          quite easily click the wrong one.&#8221;</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/img/PSactions_fig5.gif" alt="Option C: Fixations" width="450" height="604" style="padding:8px 0px;"></p>
        <p>Overall, it seems that people responded well to designs that made &#8220;Cancel&#8221; 
          stand out in some way &#8211; even if these designs slowed them down 
          a little. This suggests that they were more concerned about avoiding 
          losing their data, than they were about submitting it quickly.</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/img/PSactions_fig6.gif" alt="Options A, B, C" width="450" height="416" style="padding:8px 0px;"></p>
        <h2>Placement</h2><p>
          Only Option E performed poorly during our testing. Six people mistakenly 
          clicked on the &#8220;Cancel&#8221; button when attempting the task 
          with this design, while many more lingered over it before realizing 
          that they were about to make a mistake. People, as a whole, were around 
          six seconds slower when using this design than they were when using 
          Option B (a considerable gap when you consider that the placement of 
          the buttons was the only thing that differed between the two). They 
          also required a higher than average number of fixations to complete 
          the task (with a higher than average total fixation length and average 
          fixation length).</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/img/PSactions_fig7.gif" alt="Option E: Fixations" width="450" height="431" style="padding:8px 0px;"></p>
        <p>According to the data we collected, Option A, B, and C were the three 
          most effective designs. These prototypes shared a common characteristic: 
          all presented their &#8220;Submit&#8221; and &#8220;Cancel&#8221; options 
          on the left-hand side of the page. This suggests that left-alignment 
          of these two options is the best design choice &#8211; especially when 
          the form controls above are also left aligned. Placing the &#8220;Submit&#8221; 
          and &#8220;Cancel&#8221; buttons on the left meant that people&#8217;s 
          eyes had less distance to travel. </p>
        <p>In terms of their eye movements, people were least efficient when using 
          Option F. While all people performed the task successfully using this 
          design, our eye tracking data shows that they were more efficient when 
          using the others. People&#8217;s fixations were longest when using Option 
          F; they fixated more often on this design than on most others too. We 
          believe that this was because they expected the two buttons to be left-aligned 
          (i.e. to appear directly below the last form field on the page) and 
          upon finding that this wasn&#8217;t the case, had to search around to 
          find them.</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/img/PSactions_fig8.gif" alt="Option F: Fixations" width="450" height="531" style="padding:8px 0px;"></p>
        <p>This finding maps well to a long-standing form design principle: illuminate 
          a clear path to completion. Aligning inputs and actions with a strong 
          vertical axis clearly communicates how to go about completing a form. 
          This can be seen by the strong vertical axis formed by people&#8217;s 
          gaze paths in the heat map below.</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/img/PSactions_fig9.gif" alt="Option A: Heatmap" width="450" height="625" style="padding:8px 0px;"></p>
        <p>(Note: An element of preconditioning may also have had a bearing here 
          as in all of the other designs we tested the &#8220;Submit&#8221; button 
          was displayed to the left of the &#8220;Cancel&#8221; button.)</p>
        <h2>Summary</h2><p>
          While the primary goal of most Web form designs is to get people through 
          a form as quickly and painlessly as possible, there are situations where 
          slowing people down is advisable. When choosing between primary and 
          secondary actions, visual distinctions are a useful method for helping 
          people make good choices.</p>
        <p>Should this distinction be more prominent like the button vs. link 
          in Option A or a bit more subtle like the two different colored buttons 
          in Option C? Option A fared a bit better in time to completion, average 
          number of fixations, and average total length of fixations indicating 
          people completed the form faster but not by much.</p>
        <p>The need for these distinctions becomes moot, of course, when no secondary 
          actions are present. Make sure you really need each secondary action 
          on a form and don&#8217;t add them indiscriminately.</p>
        <p>Conversely, the alignment of actions with a form&#8217;s input elements 
          provides a clear path to completion that helps people complete forms 
          faster. Be conscious of where you place form actions as primary actions 
          directly aligned with input fields tend to increase completion rates 
          and the less time people have to spend on your forms, the happier they 
          will be.</p>
