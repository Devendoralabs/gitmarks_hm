                  <h2 align="center">Webhost at its Best 
                    &amp; Low cost, perhaps even Free!</h2>
                  <p>Please read-on for more information about how to possibly 
                    get free online public storage of your files, photo's and 
                    graphics, picture storage, large data or htm files, temporary 
                    or permanent hard-disk file storage space, and free web-host 
                  </p>
                  <p>What to look for when choosing the right website hosting, 
                    either free-web-hosting, or a paid host? A webhost is a company 
                    that provides you with server space disk storage and makes 
                    your online business and accessible to the world. They're 
                    the ones that make it possible for someone to type &quot;www.yourdomain.com&quot; 
                    into the Internet and find you quickly and easily.                  </p>
                  <p> The following tips are very crucial to consider when choosing 
                    a hosting company. Typical cost for Webhosting is anywhere 
                    between free and $10/month for basic webhosting packages, 
                    to around $20-40/month for larger web-site hosting. </p>
                  <p>You may be aware that you can get free hosting. The reason 
                    it's &quot;4-free&quot; is because the hosting provider typically 
                    pays its bills by selling advertising on your website. In 
                    other words, your website will probably display a big ugly 
                    banner or two or even annoying pop-up window advertising someone 
                    else's company or products.</p>
                  <p> A good web host will give you the following service and 
                    reliability:</p>
                  <p>&#8226; Better customer service: Free hosts are not all that 
                    inclined to help you if you run into problems; you're getting 
                    the service for &quot;free&quot;, after all!</p>
                  <p>&#8226; Credibility: Hosting on a free site makes a business 
                    look amateurish and lacking in credibility. Would you trust 
                    a company that apparently can't afford to pay a few bucks 
                    a month to a web host?!</p>
                  <p>&#8226; Features and flexibility: You'll have a lot more 
                    control over your website when you pay for web hosting service 
                    - little extras and benefits the hosting provider adds to 
                    your package to make you (or keep you) a satisfied customer.</p>
                  <p>The following are a number of factors when choosing a webhost 
                    - do not make free or price your only hosting consideration! 
                    Your business may suffer the consequences of lost profits 
                    if you choose a company that offers cheap hosting, no service, 
                    and poor reliability. Some things to look for are:</p>
                  <h3 align="center"> <font color="#008080">Fast &amp; Reliable 
                    Connection to Internet</font></h3>
                  <p>Your site must load fast - one of the major reasons visitors 
                    click-away from a website is slow loading time. Reliability 
                    speaks for itself; if your visitor can't even reach your website, 
                    there's no way you'll make a sale!</p>
                  <h3 align="left"> Excellent Uptime </h3>
                  <p>If your web host's servers go down, then your website also 
                    goes down! That translates to lost profits. On the web, you 
                    usually only have one opportunity to make an impression; blow 
                    that opportunity and your prospect typically won't come back. 
                    Find a web host with an excellent uptime record (at least 
                    99% uptime or better). Sign up for a trial if you can, and 
                    then monitor your site for uptime or downtime. </p>
                  <h3 align="left"> Site Backups &amp; Plenty of Storage Space</h3>
                  <p>It would be pretty devastating to lose all your hard work. 
                    A webhost that performs regular backups provides an extra 
                    measure of protection &quot;just in case.&quot;                  </p>
                  <p>You should be performing regular backups of your files as 
                    well. There are a number of devices that will help you do 
                    this. Check with your local computer store or <a href="http://dvdsupply.net/">DVD 
                    Supply</a> website and inquire about DVD's, tape backup drives, 
                    CD's, CD-writers, or zip drives.</p>
                  <p>How much storage space you need to store graphics, photos, 
                    pictures and files will depend on what you envision your site 
                    to be. Make sure you leave room for growth; be sure to have 
                    more than enough space for both your current and your future 
                    needs. This includes your normal web-pages, images, scripts, 
                    and anything else you may want to use for your website.</p>
                  <p>It's hard to say how much space an &quot;average site&quot; 
                    uses. That depends on the length of the web-pages and the 
                    number and size of images. One of our websites has nearly 
                    200 pages and uses about 5 MB. It does not have any graphics 
                    except for my logo. Another one of my sites uses 7 MB for 
                    only 50 pages or so, but it has lots of pictures. It's a judgment 
                    call as to how much space you'll need.</p>
                  <p>Keep in mind that there's no such thing as 'unlimited space'. 
                    There is always a limit to the amount of storage space a web-host 
                    can offer. This is not a bad thing - you just be sure that 
                    it's enough to cover you and your future needs. Storage space 
                    by itself is not a deciding factor. If you are concerned, 
                    ask your host how much they charge for additional disk storage 
                    space.                  </p>
                  <p>Remember, you will require a lot of file storage space for 
                    extensive photos and picture storage. Graphics, 
                    <!--<a href="http://emul.najlepsze.net/">
				  eMule</A>-->
                    images and photographs use very large amounts of hard-disk 
                    storage space, much more disc space than you would expect 
                    vs text, documents and htm files for example.</p>
                  <h3 align="left"> Adequate Transfer Space </h3>
                  <p>Every time someone views a web page, they're actually downloading 
                    data. Read the fine print in the contract to see if you are 
                    limited to a certain percentage of system resources. We have 
                    seen estimates that an average user needs anywhere from 50 
                    to 150 MB a month for their website traffic. Web hosts may 
                    charge you extra if you go over the transfer limit. Look for 
                    a hosting package that gives you more than you need.</p>
                  <h3 align="left"> CGI Bin </h3>
                  <p>Many web-hosts will provide you with some standard CGI scripts 
                    for things such as counters, forms, and passwords. Check with 
                    your prospective host to see what types of &quot;standard&quot; 
                    free scripts they offer for your use.</p>
                  <p>Also make sure you have the ability to create and upload 
                    your own CGI scripts, what web hosts typically refer to as 
                    your own &quot;cgi-bin&quot;. You should not be restricted 
                    to what the web host offers. Ask questions like, Can you install 
                    these scripts on your own without requesting permission from 
                    your host? Will your host charge you for each script you install?</p>
                  <p>You might be thinking, &quot;I don't know how to program 
                    my own CGI scripts, so who cares whether or not I have my 
                    own cgi- bin?&quot; One of the nice things about the Internet 
                    is that there are countless CGI scripts available, some scripts 
                    are available for free!. You can easily learn to install simple 
                    scripts yourself, or hire a programmer to write the script 
                    for you.</p>
                  <h3 align="left"> Secure Server Capability </h3>
                  <p>Secure servers allow you to transmit pages in an encrypted 
                    format. This is necessary if you plan on selling something 
                    directly from your website and of course you will need it 
                    for accepting credit cards, if you don't use what's known 
                    as a third-party processing company. Look for a web host that 
                    offers secure server capability for low or no additional costs.</p>
                  <h3 align="left"> Auto responders, Email Aliases, Forwarders 
                    &amp; Mailboxes </h3>
                  <p>How many of each you'll need depends on your business. Don't 
                    be influenced by offers of &quot;unlimited email accounts&quot; 
                    - you probably won't need them.</p>
                  <p>As a home business owner you are most likely going to be 
                    the sole employee for quite some time. So what use would you 
                    have for 100 email accounts? You can use something called 
                    an email alias instead. An alias is allows you to set up &quot;fake&quot; 
                    addresses, such as sales@yourdomain.com or info@yourdomain.com 
                    ... but in reality, these aliases are simply your main email 
                    account. That means that any email sent to these aliases will 
                    automatically be sent to your main account.</p>
                  <p>An auto-responder is extremely important for online business 
                    owners. It's simply an email address that you can set up to 
                    respond automatically with a pre configured message. For example, 
                    instead of manually emailing a report to everyone who requests 
                    it, let your auto responder handle it for you instead. Many 
                    hosts offer simple auto responders with no follow-up capability. 
                    These are OK in some instances. In most cases, expect to purchase 
                    an auto responder outside of your web hosting package.</p>
                  <h3 align="left">Mailing Lists</h3>
                  <p>Many hosting services offer a feature where you can create 
                    your own mailing list, a handy feature for when you want to 
                    start your own ezine or newsletter! Note that there are often 
                    restrictions on how many lists you can create, and on how 
                    many addresses can be on each list.</p>
                  <p>When you're first starting out on the web, this is a convenient 
                    little feature if your host offers it to you for free. That 
                    means you might not have to pay for mailing list software 
                    of your own if money is tight. I still recommend a professional 
                    list host or autoresponder to manage your list.</p>
                  <h3 align="left"> Analyzing Visitor Traffic </h3>
                  <p>Analyzing your hits and traffic is an important part of doing 
                    business online. A good stats program is <a href="http://weblizer.com/">Webalizer</a>, 
                    which is often included free by your hosting firm, it includes 
                    extensive site visitor demographics, such as number of page 
                    views, unique visitors numbers, referrers (where your visitors 
                    are coming from), browsers used, and other valuable information. 
                    Again, a host that offers good site demographics can save 
                    you from purchasing another service.</p>
                  <h3 align="left"> Unlimited &amp; Responsive Customer Service</h3>
                  <p> Make sure you can get the help you need, when you need it. 
                    It can be very frustrating if you run into a problem and can't 
                    find anyone to help you! With a good web host you won't need 
                    support services very often, but when you do you want to be 
                    able to contact someone immediately. Contact a prospective 
                    web host with questions before you sign up for their services. 
                    That way you'll be able to get an idea of how promptly they 
                    respond to your concerns, and how helpful they are. Prompt 
                    service isn't enough, though. Support staff should be qualified, 
                    trained, technical professionals who know how to talk to customers.</p>
                  <h3 align="left"> Money-back Guarantee </h3>
                  <p>You should be able to try out your web host and get your 
                    money back if you are unsatisfied with them for any reason. 
                    Most web hosts offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>
                  <h3 align="left"> No Minimum Contract Required</h3>
                  <p>Are you required to 'lock-in' a contract for a year, two 
                    years, or more? Look for a host that will let you pay month 
                    by month if that's what you prefer.</p>
                  <h3 align="left">Finding the Right Web hosting Company </h3>
                  <p>Do your homework and compare a number of webhosts to see 
                    who offers the best value and service for your money. We recommend 
                    you check-out <a href="http://webfirms.com/">webfirms.com</a> 
                    for all your web-hosting, file-storage, graphics, image and 
                    photo/picture disk storage needs!</p>
                  <h3 align="left">Get Free Webhosting, Free File Storage &amp; 
                    Free Image Storage! </h3>
                  <p>This is how you can get free web-hosting and disc storage 
                    space! There are two ways: One way is to buy (or transfer) 
                    a minimum of 10 new domain names from our suggested <a href="http://renewdomainnow.com/">

                    is to buy a developed website using our domain brokerage service 
                    to qualify your own site for <a href="http://freeisp.us/">Free 
                    ISP</a> Webhosting for 6-months! If you wish to continue your 
                    hosting we can maintain your hosting for guaranteed low-cost
