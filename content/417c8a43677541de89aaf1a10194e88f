<P>


<P>My <a href="615.html">lesson-plan</a> having survived first contact with
the <strike>enemy</strike> students, it's time to start posting the lecture
handouts &amp; c.  This page will be updated as the semester goes on; the RSS
feed for it should be <a href="617.rss">here</a>.
The <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/">class homepage</a> has more
information.

to the course</a> (24 August) What is data mining? how is it used? where did it
come from? Some themes.

retrieval and similarity searching I</a> (26 August) Finding the data you are
looking for.  Ideas we will avoid: meta-data and cataloging; meanings.  Textual

similarity and distance for vectors.  Example with the <cite><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008T19">New York Times

<li> <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/02/lecture-02.pdf">IR continued</a> (28 August).  The
trick to searching: queries are documents.  Search evaluation: precision,
recall, precision-recall curves; error rates.  Classification: nearest
neighbors and prototypes; classifier evaluation by mis-classification rate and
by confusion matrices.  Inverse document frequency weighting.  Visualizing
high-dimensional data by multi-dimensional scaling.  Miscellaneous topics:

<P>Homework 4, due 25
September: <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/hw/04/hw-04.pdf">assignment</a>; <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/hw/04/solutions-04.pdf">solutions</a>

<li> <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/11/lecture-11.pdf">Principal
Components II</a> (21 September).  PCA + information retrieval = latent
semantic indexing; why LSI is a Good Idea.  PCA and multidimensional scaling.
<li> <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/12/lecture-12.pdf">Factor
Analysis</a> (23 and 25 September).  From PCA to factor analysis by adding
noise.  Roots of factor analysis in causal discovery: Spearman's general factor
model and the tetrad equations.  Problems with estimating factor models: number
of equations does not equal number of unknowns.  Solution 1, "principal
factors", a.k.a. estimation through heroic feats of linear algebra.  Solution
2, maximum likelihood, a.k.a. estimation through imposing distributional
assumptions.  The rotation problem: the factor model <em>is</em>
unidentifiable; the number of factors may be meaningful, but the individual
factors are not.
<li> <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/13/lecture-13.pdf">The
Truth about PCA and Factor Analysis</a> (28 September) PCA is data reduction
without any probabilistic assumptions about where the data came from.  Picking
number of components.  Faking predictions from PCA.  Factor analysis makes
stronger, probabilistic assumptions, and delivers stronger, predictive
conclusions --- which could be wrong.  Using probabilistic assumptions and/or
predictions to pick how many factors.  Factor analysis as a first, toy
instances of a graphical causal model.  The rotation problem once more with
feeling.  Factor models and mixture models.  Factor models and Thomson's
sampling model: an outstanding fit to a model with a few factors is actually
evidence of a <em>huge</em> number of <em>badly measured</em> latent variables.
Final advice: it all depends, but if you can only do one, try PCA.

code for the Thomson sampling model</a>.
<li> <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/14/lecture-14.pdf">Nonlinear
Dimensionality Reduction I: Locally Linear Embedding</a> (5 October).  Failure
of PCA and all other linear methods for nonlinear structures in data; spirals,
for example.  Approximate success of linear methods on small parts of nonlinear
structures.  Manifolds: smoothly curved surfaces embedded in higher-dimensional
Euclidean spaces.  Every manifold looks like a linear subspace on a
sufficiently small scale, so we should be able to patch together many small
local linear approximations into a global manifold.  Local linear embedding:
approximate each vector in the data as a weighted linear combination of
its <em>k</em> nearest neighbors, then find the low-dimensional vectors best
reconstructed by these weights.  Solving the optimization problems by linear
algebra.  Coding up LLE.  A spiral
rainbow.  <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/14/lecture-14.R">R</a>.

Advantages when data are not actually on a manifold.  Example.

<li><a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/16/lecture-16.pdf">Regression
I: Basics</a>.  Guessing a real-valued random variable; why expectation values
are mean-square optimal point forecasts.  The regression function; why its
estimation must involve assumptions beyond the data.  The bias-variance
decomposition and the bias-variance trade-off.  First example of improving
prediction by introducing variance.  Ordinary least squares linear regression
as smoothing.  Other linear smoothers: <em>k</em>-nearest-neighbors and kernel
regression.  How much should we
smooth?  <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/16/lecture-16-for-students.R">R</a>, <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/16/examples.dat">data
for running example</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/17/lecture-17.pdf">Regression
II: The Truth About Linear Regression</a> (21 October).  Linear regression is
optimal linear (mean-square) prediction; we do this because we hope a linear
approximation will work well enough over a small range.  What linear regression
does: decorrelate the input features, then correlate them separately with the
response and add up.  The extreme weakness of the probabilistic assumptions
needed for this to make sense.  Difficulties of linear regression;
collinearity, errors in variables, shifting distributions of inputs, omitted
variables.  The usual extra probabilistic assumptions and their implications.
Why you should always looking at residuals.  Why you generally shouldn't use
regression for causal inference.  How to torment angels.  Likelihood-ratio
tests for restrictions of nice models.
<li> <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/18/lecture-18.pdf">Regression III: Extending Linear
Regression</a> (23 October).  Weighted least squares.  Heteroskedasticity:
variance is not the same everywhere.  Going to consult the oracle.  Weighted
least squares as a solution to heteroskedasticity.  Nonparametric estimation of
the variance function.  Local polynomial regression: local constants (= kernel
regression), local linear regression, higher-order local polynomials.  Lowess =
locally-linear smoothing for scatter plots.  The oracles fall silent.

<li> <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/20/lecture-20.pdf">Smoothing
Methods in Regression</a> (30 October).  How much smoothing should we do?
Approximation by local averaging.  How much smoothing we <em>should</em> do to
find the unknown curve depends on how smooth the curve <em>really</em> is,
which is unknown.  Adaptation as a partial substitute for actual knowledge.
Cross-validation for adapting to unknown smoothness.  Application: testing
parametric regression models by comparing them to nonparametric fits.  The
bootstrap principle.  Why ever bother with parametric
regressions?  <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/20/lecture-20.R">R

Models</a> (2 November).  A nice feature of linear models: partial responses,
partial residuals, and backfitting estimations.  Additive models: regression
curve is a sum of partial response functions; partial residuals and the
backfitting trick generalize.  Parametric and non-parametric rates of
convergence.  The curse of dimensionality for unstructured nonparametric
models.  Additive models as a compromise, introducing bias to reduce variance.

errors; likelihood; Neyman-Pearson classifiers.  Uncertainty for trees.

optimization.  Generalized linear models and generalized additive models;
testing GLM specifications with GAMs.
<li> <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/27/lecture-27.pdf">Support Vector Machines</a> (20
November).  Turning nonlinear problems into linear ones by expanding into
high-dimensional feature spaces.  The dual representation of linear
classifiers: weight training points, not features.  Observation: in the dual
representation, only inner products of vectors matter.  The kernel trick:
kernel functions let us compute inner products in feature spaces without
computing the features.  Some bounds on the generalization error of linear
classifiers based on "margin" and the number of training points with non-zero
weight ("support vectors").  Learning support vector machines by trading
in-sample performance against bounds on over-fitting.

probabilistic clustering; finally an answer to "how many clusters?"  The EM
algorithm as an iterative way of maximizing likelihood with latent variables.
