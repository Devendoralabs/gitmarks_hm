    DIYcity: How do you want to reinvent your city?</a></h2>


  <div class="content clear-block">
        <p>Attention all innovators, entrepreneurs, hackers, thinkers and people of open mind: the time has come to reinvent your city.  Reinvent it not in the image of the city we are all familiar with, but as something altogether new: something intelligent, efficient and open, something livable and sustainable, something that not only works, but works better than we've ever imagined. </p>
<p>The time is now to do this.  And who are the ones who will do it?  We are - all of us.  We are the ones with the tools, the innovative ideas, and the incentives to make our cities better in a million ways.  </p>
<p>The shift is already beginning to happen, and every day it is going faster and faster.  </p>
<p>And so now it is time for a new sort of city, a truly do-it-ourselves city to emerge.</p>
<p>So: shall we get started?</p>

        <p>The London-based Networked Neighbourhoods has released a set of extremely important studies on "the social impact of citizen-run online neighbourhood networks and the implications for local authorities."</p>
<p>This connects to the heart of the use of open government by the public - you need online public spaces where citizens in the context of governance (particularly with elected officials who can say, these are MY voters talking) are asking for information and generating new public opinion. These online spaces be they "community sites" or a dozen of the different technologies and approaches, are essential for everyday citizens to discuss government and broader community affairs. These exchanges generate general demand for and often specific requests for government information.</p>
<p>Also, from a DIY perspective, it is though these spaces that we see critical mass local adhocracy or coproduction opportunities emerge. (This what we see increasingly here <a href="http://e-democracy.org/nf" title="http://e-democracy.org/nf">http://e-democracy.org/nf</a> at the neighborhood level.)</p>

  <div class="content clear-block">
        <p>Hi all - tt's been a few weeks since I've gotten around to posting at DIYcity, so I wanted to give a quick update.  </p>
<p>One reason I've been posting less to DIYcity is that I started a blog on johngeraci.com (<a href="http://johngeraci.com/blog/">check it out here</a>).  I did this b/c I was getting the urge to write about things on DIYcity that weren't totally appropriate to the focus of this space.  DIYcity has never been a ponderous place - it's always been a place for action, for building, and for discussion about these things.  In the past few months I'd gotten away from that and wanted to restore that feeling here.  So from now on, my thinky posts go on my blog, and DIYcity is for building, and talking about building.  That means less content here but more focus and direction.  I think that will be a good thing in the long run.</p>
<p>Next: the idea for the Apps for Everywhere contest continues to mature and take shape.  It's making a lot more sense now, and we've got a few groups behind the scenes expressing interest in helping out in various ways.  So that is looking increasingly do-able, interesting and valuable.  I think we'll probably make a call on whether or not to green-light it over the holidays, and get on it quickly if it's a go.</p>
<p>Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/apps-for-everywhere">Apps for Everywhere Google Group</a> if you want to chime in on the discussion that is giving shape to the idea. </p>
<p>Lastly, I wanted to call people's attention to <a href="http://diycity.org/diy-milwaukee/questions-journalists-politicians-and-police-departments-about-public-information-acce">a good post by dpk</a> the other day about accessibility to police information in Milwaukee.  It raises some questions that would be great to get into in more depth in a broader context at some point.  Dpk posted it to Milwaukee, so I wanted to call others' attention to it as well.</p>
<p>That's all for now.  The last few weeks of 2010 will be quiet here as I'll be up in Montreal (if anyone reading lives up there, get in touch with me, maybe we can get coffee and discuss the road ahead for DIY cities.)</p>
<p>More to come, as always...</p>

        <p>When Bradley Tech, a troubled Milwaukee public high school, had to be locked down and receive massive police support to stop a fight involving gang members and kids from other schools, the most important issue is not about the school, the 18 arrests, the gangs, the fight, or the police response. It's about having no public information about the incident, which occurred on Nov. 30, until a statement was dragged out of the police department a week later, as rumors and questioned reached the press and political leaders.</p>

<p>Similar patterns of significant crimes that only come to light weeks after the fact have occurred since the Milwaukee Police Department's encrypted radio system, OpenSky, went into full production use early in 2010. The problem is that, post-OpenSky, MPD has left no way for the media or anyone else to follow what squads are doing, within reasonable parameters, as used to be the case. Going from police scanners to nearly nothing was a major disruption to public information access and crucial information flows in and outside of the city government.</p>
<p>Now, when a major incident fails to attract immediate media notice and no MPD statement is forthcoming, victims, witnesses or second and third-hand sources tend to generate inquiries and exposes a week or two later, when the media and politicians get involved. This has become a repetitive and counterproductive cycle for the entire metropolitan community.</p>
<p>There are technological solutions possible, but none have been proposed until today, when MPD suggested that the 911 dispatch webpage with brief call type summaries on the MPD website is all the press needs. Is it really MPD's position that this is all the press needs?</p>
<p>In other words, does a line of text that says "fight" with a location given like "4th and Bruce" do the job? This line of text appears only for a brief period of time and is not retrievable later. It appears somewhere within 5 screens of similar summaries. Is this really adequate public notice? Are journalists supposed to refresh their browsers all day watching these pages, instead of expecting a statement from MPS or MPD when many squads are called to stop a fight in a school and make arrests? On numerous occasions, the entire dispatch page has gone offline without warning, sometimes over long holiday weekends.</p>
<p>MPD claims that "All dispatched calls for police service are posted, with a 30-minute delay, on the Milwaukee Police Department Website under the Dispatched Calls for Police Service Tab." In fact the dispatch page itself actually says the calls are those made by 911 dispatch operators and the delay is 30-90 minutes. Previously it has been stated by MPD that some calls may be withheld longer in special cases, and 911 dispatch operators are not the only source of calls for service. Squads can be sent to locations by non-emergency operators and probably other channels, so it's unclear what is and is not being shown.</p>
<p>In the specific case of Bradley Tech on the 30th, was a 911 call made? Was a 911 call made that resulted in a dispatch? If a code red or lockdown is issued by a school, does this involve dispatch logs that go on the MPD website? </p>
<p>A national crime-mapping website, SpotCrime.com, harvests all data it is able to collect from MPD's dispatch page and has no entries pertaining to Bradley Tech for the 30th. Usually it is a reliable, permanent record of what has been posted by MPD, but even it is a very limited solution to the void of timely information about police activity.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://rjicollab.ning.com/profiles/blogs/questions-for-milwaukees?xg_source=activity#ixzz17XOhdA7K" target="_blank">This was first posted at the RJI News Collaboratory</a></em>.<em>Unfortunately, when I first asked these questions (in shorter form) on MPD's Facebook page, they were deleted. The situation has reached a point where I think there is motivation now to independently create applications to provide the data and accessibility needed to really function in the public interest. I am interested in hearing from anyone who is aware of similar situations in other cities, and how they were dealt with.</em></p>

          </div>

  <div class="content clear-block">
        <p>Hi DIYcity folks - I wanted to give a brief update on the Apps for Everywhere idea I've been kicking around (and am now kicking around with several other people).</p>
<p>First of all, the place to discuss it if you want is on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/apps-for-everywhere">Apps for Everywhere Google Group</a>.  The group has eight members in it currently - still cozy, but with promise.  Join now if you're interested.</p>
<p>Then, a few things that have come up in conversations on and off the group list:</p>
<p>- We've realized that a contest like this would be much more likely to succeed with some sort of on-the-ground network of developers in cities around the world.  So we're taking names of people who are interested in promoting such a contest in their own city.  So far we have Philadelphia and Milwaukee represented (and maybe Buenos Aires, though I have to confirm that).  It's a start!  Would you be interested in helping promote a contest like this to developers in your city?  If so, get in touch with me, or join the group.</p>
<p>- Everyone is talking about data data data!  A common refrain is that an apps contest can't happen without open data from the city.  To that, two ideas have emerged in response:</p>
<p>One is that a really interesting global app contest could happen without open data, if it had the notion of data scraping built into it.  That could be a very interesting contest: scrape data and build the best app for your (closed) city.  And with new tools like Google Refine, and with Sunlight Foundation's new scraping initiative, this could really provide some interesting tools.</p>
<p>The second is that maybe a global contest about city-focused apps could in and of itself be a <em>way</em> to help cities everywhere to open up data.  Or at least get the message out to cities around the world about open data and its value.  And maybe that would be where the meat of the value was in such a contest?  Too early to say, but it's an interesting, provocative idea that seems to touch a nerve with people.</p>
<p>So: </p>
<p>• an apps contest for the whole world<br />
• that tapped into local developer networks in cities to drive participation<br />
• and that relied on state-of-the-art scraping where necessary<br />
• but that also (and maybe more importantly) acted as a stimulus for cities everywhere to open up their data and make it available to developers to build on.</p>
<p>That's where the idea is, one week into the discussion.</p>
<p>I'm still absolutely not decided on doing this.  I have several other ideas/discussions in this vein running at the same time that are competing for my attention.  As I'm sure you do, too.</p>
<p>But it is definitely an interesting idea.  </p>
<p>If anyone wants to make it an even better idea, please <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/apps-for-everywhere">be my guest</a>.</p>

  <div class="content clear-block">
        <p>I'm thinking through this idea for <a href="http://diycity.org/diycity-main-group/question-diycity-discussions-you-weigh">an apps contest for everywhere</a> a bit more, and would love to hear from people in cities outside of NYC, D.C. and Portland (where apps contests are already happening).  That includes cities in the U.S. as well as cities outside of the U.S.  </p>
<p>Would you be interested in seeing an apps contest in your city?  In Amsterdam?  In Paris?  In Los Angeles?  In Philadelphia?  </p>
<p>If so, drop me a line at geraci at gmail dot com.  I want to chat.  </p>
<p>Or you can reply to <a href="http://diycity.org/discussions/question-anyone-and-everyone-weigh">the thread in the Discussions group</a> .  Or you can <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/apps-for-everywhere">join the Google Group</a> that I set up yesterday to talk about this.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

        <p>I set up a Google Group for anyone who wants to drill down on the idea of hosting an apps contest for any and every city in the world.  The group's home page is at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/apps-for-everywhere" title="http://groups.google.com/group/apps-for-everywhere">http://groups.google.com/group/apps-for-everywhere</a>  If you're interested in working through it, helping decide if it's a workable idea, and figuring out how to make it really great, drop in and sign up.</p>
<p>Or feel free to write a reply to <a href="http://diycity.org/discussions/question-anyone-and-everyone-weigh">yesterday's thread</a>, if you'd rather.</p>
<p>I will post periodically to Discussions and the Main Group about the idea if it continues to grow.  But a Google Group will allow anyone interested to talk as much as they want without bothering the others on this list. </p>

    Some Thoughts on an Apps for Everywhere Contest</a></h2>

  <div class="content clear-block">
        <p>A few thoughts on <a href="http://diycity.org/discussions/question-anyone-and-everyone-weigh">yesterday's thread about the possibility of holding an apps for everywhere contest</a>:</p>
<p>- <a href="http://diycity.org/discussions/question-anyone-and-everyone-weigh#comment-892">Geddes' comment</a>, that cities need data to have successful contests, rings very true.  That's something that would have to be factored into any contest, in one way or another.  There are lots of ways to approach this.  One way would be to have two phases to a contest: the first phase involves discovering and organizing data sets for cities (with prizes) and the second phase involves building on those data sets.  Other ways involve.... ? (Still thinking about this).</p>
<p>- <a href="http://diycity.org/discussions/question-anyone-and-everyone-weigh#comment-895">Mariano's point</a>, that many cities around the world do not have a critical mass of smart phones is also a good one.  An effective "apps for everywhere" contest for the whole world would need to focus on apps for simpler mobile devices, as well as make use of common web 1.0 technology to really address the people it was claiming to address.</p>
<p>- If such a contest were to take root, it would need some level of on-the-ground support in cities around the world.  To that effect, I would love to hear from people out there in cities other than NYC and DC who might have some interest in seeing this happen in their city.</p>
<p>- I'm thinking I'll start a Google Group for anyone who wants to actively kick this idea around with me.  The DIYcity Discussions list has several hundred people on it, and I think that may actually dampen conversation at this point, as nobody wants to be stuffing other people's inboxes with multiple messages about things they may not care about.  Will be back with that info in a bit.</p>
<p>Still just kicking this idea around, in the realm of the hypothetical...</p>
