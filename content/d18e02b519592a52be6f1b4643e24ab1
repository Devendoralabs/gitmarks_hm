<i>Abstract</i>:<br>

An important part of our information-gathering behavior has
always been to 
find out what other people think.  With the growing availability
and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites
and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people
can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and
understand the opinions of others.  The sudden eruption of activity in
the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with
the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in
text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the
surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a
first-class object.

<p>

This survey covers techniques and approaches 
that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking
systems.
Our focus is on methods
that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware
applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis.
We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on 
broader issues regarding privacy, vulnerability to manipulation, and
economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented
information-access services gives rise to. 
To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources,
benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.
