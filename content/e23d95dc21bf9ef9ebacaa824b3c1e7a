<P>The specification describes a method of protecting jokes by filing patent
     applications therefor, and gives examples of novel jokes to be thus
     protected. Specific jokes to be protected by the process of the invention
     include stories about animals playing ball-games, in which alliteration
     is used in the punch-line; a scheme for raising money for charity by
     providing dogs for carriage by Underground passengers; and the joke that
     consists in filing a patent application to protect jokes. A novel type of
     patent application, one that claims itself, and hence is termed
     `homoproprietary`, is disclosed.

<HR>
<BR><BR>[0001] The present invention relates to a novel business method. More
     particularly, it relates to a method of protecting novel jokes, and to
     jokes that may be so protected.
<BR><BR>[0002] Knowledge is a free good. However, producing new knowledge usually
     costs money. Increasingly it is recognised that investment in producing
     new knowledge needs to be encouraged by protection for the results of
     that investment. The protection available for these results has expanded
     over time. For example, under the old UK patent law before 1978,
     protection was only available for a `manner of manufacture`. This
     requirement was construed broadly, for example to include methods of
     dispersing fog. In 1978, the UK adopted the new European code, which
     provided protection for `inventions susceptible of industrial
     application`. The new European law specifically excludes various things,
     including:
<BR><BR>[0003] "discoveries; aesthetic creations; . . . schemes, rules and methods
     for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and programs
     for computers; presentations of information". Also excepted are surgery,
     therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body; as
     well as plant and animal varieties.
<BR><BR>[0004] However, over the years European jurisprudence has narrowed several
     of these exceptions. Thus, for example, though discoveries per se remain
     unpatentable, newly isolated gene sequences can be patented, though many
     regard them as no more than discoveries; programs for computers can be
     patented if they give rise to a `technical effect`; plant varieties can
     be protected by patent where the invention claimed is broader than a
     single specific variety; and novel uses of known pharmaceuticals can be
     protected by means of `Swiss-type` claims (preparation of a compound "for
     use in the manufacture of a treatment for disease X").
<BR><BR>[0005] At present, practice in the European patent office does not permit
     the patenting of `business methods` (at least, where no `technical
     effect` can be demonstrated). However, as previously noted, practice does
     not stand still. Increasingly, globalisation leads to pressure for
     conformity in world practice, so innovations in one country may rapidly
     be taken up by others.
<BR><BR>[0006] It is thus significant that the USA has recently clarified its law
     on the patenting of `business methods`. The State Street Bank case (State
     Street Bank & Trust Co.
<BR><BR>[0007] v. Signature Financial Group Inc., CAFC, 23 Jul. 1998) clarified
     that, contrary to what had often been thought, there was no per se rule
     against patenting business methods. This ruling has given rise to a wave
     of `business method` patents, including for example the well-known
     `one-click` patent of Amazon, U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,411, on a method of
     placing purchase orders on a communications network (such as the
     Internet);
<BR><BR>[0008] Most forms of medicine can be protected by patent applications in
     most countries. In the European Patent Office, for example, a new
     chemical compound useful as a pharmaceutical can be protected per se. Old
     chemical compounds can be protected for use as medicines. Where a known
     drug (D) is found to be effective against a new ailment(A), this
     discovery can be protected, by means of a `Swiss-type claim`--"Use of
     drug D in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of ailment
     A".
<BR><BR>[0009] As the old saying goes: "Laughter is the best medicine". Protection
     should be available for this medicine also. Nor is the utility of jokes
     confined to the medicinal field: a number of other utilities are noted
     below. There is a clear need here for intellectual property protection,
     so as to reward those who devise effective novel jokes, and encourage the
     investment of time, effort and money in this pursuit.
<BR><BR>[0010] The present invention proposes a way of procuring protection for a
     new joke, which comprises filing a patent application therefor defining
     the novel features thereof. According to a further feature of the
     invention, the patent application and any resulting patent is maintained
     (e.g., by refraining from all acts that would result in its abandonment,
     by requesting publication, by prosecution, preferably to grant, by
     defending oppositions, by paying maintenance and renewal fees, and so on.
     It is preferred to mark the joke with the patent application number, when
     the joke is published in fixed form. In further aspects the invention
     comprises a method of licensing protected jokes, which comprises filing a
     patent application for a new joke, and offering licenses for use of the
     joke.
<BR><BR>[0011] In a second aspect, the invention comprises novel jokes for
     protection by the process of the invention.
<BR><BR>[0012] The present invention provides an answer to a long-felt need,
     namely that of obtaining proper protection for jokes. It is known from
     the prior art to file patent applications which are funny, intentionally
     or otherwise (it is not always easy to tell which). Examples of such
     applications are, in the UK, those of Arthur Pedrick (including GB
     1047735, relating to a method of irrigating arid regions by supplying
     them by pipeline with snowballs from the Poles, and GB 1426698 entitled
     "Photon Push-Pull Radiation Detector For Use In Chromatically Selective
     Cat Flap Control And 1000 Megaton Earth-Orbital Peace-Keeping Bomb": in
     the USA, U.S. Pat. No. 5,616,089 issued Apr. 1, 1997, to a method of
     gripping a golf putter; U.S. Pat. No. 6,368,227 for a method of swinging
     on a child's swing.
<BR><BR>[0013] However, previously patent applications have not been filed to
     protect jokes as such. This clearly shows the existence of a prejudice,
     which the present invention overcomes. The prejudice has taken several
     forms. It has been thought that a joke is not suitable subject-matter for
     a patent, for example because it is not `technical`. More specifically,
     it has been urged that a joke is an `aesthetic creation`. However, many
     things that are patented are `aesthetic creations` at least in some form.
     Any well-designed utilitarian object is an `aesthetic creation`, and may
     be protected, in that aspect, by copyright or design right (registered or
     unregistered). This is no bar to protecting it by patent, if it is also
     new and inventive. Thus, the fact that a joke is, in its finished form,
     an aesthetic creation need not be an absolute bar to protecting its novel
     principle by patent, The situation is analogous to the European patent
     law on plant varieties, which refuses protection for specific varieties
     per se, but allows patents covering classes of varieties (EPO Enlarged
     Board, case G2/95). Jokes can of course be protected by copyright, but
     copyright only protects the form in which the joke is expressed. Patent
     protection will offer protection for the essential features of the
     joke--its underlying structure.
<BR><BR>[0014] The present invention has more than one aspect. It includes: the
     process of protecting new jokes by filing patent applications thereon;
     and the novel jokes disclosed in the examples. More specifically it
     includes the particular joke which is the idea or concept of filing this
     particular patent application (self-reference).
<BR><BR>[0015] An essential feature of the invention is the filing of a patent
     application chatacterising the novel joke, defining the novel feature, or
     combination of features, thereof. It is preferred to prosecute the patent
     application at least to publication, and if possible to grant. However,
     these are not essential aspects. Filing of a patent application
     constitutes a claim to exclusive rights, and such rights may be licensed
     even if not certainly valid. At the time of writing, patents for
     inventions relating to `business methods` may be granted by the US Patent
     Office, the Australian Patent Office and probably by other Patent
     Offices, for example the Japanese Patent Office. They are typically
     refused by the European Patent Office. However, it is quite possible that
     this illiberal practice will change: as noted above, the tendency, in the
     European Patent Office and elsewhere, is continually to widen the
     categories of patentability. Thus, applications according to the
     invention may be filed in countries where the law is currently
     unfavourable: even if the law has not changed, they may benefit from the
     expectation that it will change, or even the possibility that it could.
     And in many countries the examination of patents is quite slow. A patent
     application may be kept pending for a number of years while all
     possibilities of appeal, divisional filings, continuations, etc., are
     exhausted. Competitors have to consider, not only what the law is, but
     what it might become. And potential infringers need to consider the
     inconvenience and expense of being sued, even if assured by credible
     legal advice that they will ultimately win.
<BR><BR>[0016] Where the patent application to be filed according to the invention
     is a US patent application, or an application that will give rise to a US
     application, for example a PCT application designating USA, or a national
     application from which priority may be claimed, it is a preferred feature
     of the invention to establish conception of the joke prior to filing the
     US application. This may be done by writing down the joke, having it read
     and understood and signed, dated and witnessed as such by an independent
     witness. The witness should be a person having an average sense of
     humour, and sufficient wit to be able to understand the joke, but
     preferably not so much as to be likely to improve it. Improvements to the
     joke by the witness may give the status of co-inventor, thereby removing
     the witness's independent status, and hence the legal value of the
     witness's corroboration. Preferably the joke, having been conceived, is
     reduced to practice. Provided the witness to conception understands the
     joke, and preferably laughs, the act of witnessing the conception may
     constitute reduction to practice of the joke (except in the case of
     practical jokes, see below). If not, it may be necessary to tell the joke
     to an audience. However, if it is desired to protect the joke outside the
     USA, the audience must be under an obligation of confidence, otherwise
     the disclosure to the audience may deprive the joke of novelty and render
     it unprotectable. The invention further contemplates the exercise of
     diligence in reducing the joke to practice following conception, but, as
     noted, in most circumstances the witnessing of conception will constitute
     reduction to practice.
<BR><BR>[0017] Jokes according to the invention may be recited or (in some cases)
     rehearsed. To recite a joke is to recount it, either orally, or in
     writing or other symbolic form. It may also be recited by presentation in
     a dramatic performance (e.g., theatre, film, television, video games). It
     may be rehearsed by enacting it, that is to say, by actually carrying it
     out. Practical jokes are intended for reproduction by rehearsal, but may
     also be exploited by recounting them (this will usually be more
     convenient, if less funny).
<BR><BR>[0018] Jokes may be recorded in print or other permanent or semi-permanent
     media. It is particularly preferred according the invention to record
     novel jokes on computer systems (for example, the Internet) or
     computer-readable media (floppy discs, CDs, DVDs and the like), not only
     for convenience in dissemination, but also because such media may be
     easier to protect under European patent jurisprudence.
<BR><BR>[0019] Royalties may be collected, from a willing licensee, from the date
     of publication of the patent application: and licensees may be encouraged
     to sign up willingly by offering differential royalty rates: for example,
     preferential royalties may be offered to those prepared to pay now. An
     added inducement would be the offer to return part of the royalties paid
     in the event of the patent not ultimately being granted.
<BR><BR>[0020] All kinds of jokes may be protected by the process of the present
     invention. The joke may be completely new (though, as Grove J. said in
     the nineteenth century of mechanical inventions: "The claim may be that
     the whole thing is a novelty. It is difficult to suppose such patents at
     the present day . . . " [Young and Neilson v. Rosenthal & Co, 1 RPC p29,
     at p. 33-1884]). It may be an improvement or embellishment or adaptation,
     e.g. updating, of a known joke type. It may take the form of an anecdote,
     a pun, a wisecrack, irony, a `shaggy dog story`, a cartoon. It may be a
     joke that carries an existing tendency to an absurd limit (reductio ad
     absurdum). Jokes may be self-referential or recursive: for example the
     well known: "It was a dark and stormy night: and the captain said to the
     mate: `Antonio, tell us a story!` And thus the mate began: `It was a dark
     and stormy night." [etc.] . . . A particularly preferred form of joke is
     one in which the intentions of the teller are uncertain: is the intention
     humorous or serious, or both? The invention envisages both verbal
     (including oral) jokes and visual jokes, e.g., cartoons, drawings; or
     they may be practical jokes. Practical jokes, for example novel forms of
     the traditional pail of water supported on a partly open door to drench
     unwary entrants, may be rehearsed (enacted physically), as well as
     recited. Jokes may be transposed from one culture or setting to another:
     for example, jokes told by the Irish about the English may be told by the
     English about the Irish: and such transposition may in certain
     circumstances be inventive.
<BR><BR>[0021] Jokes have various functions and utilities. The main function of a
     joke is to amuse. However, in many situations a joke has additional
     utilities. Thus a joke may be told to put an audience at ease, to attract
     attention (as in humorous advertisements), to point a moral (didactic or
     campaigning jokes) or to fix a point in the audience's memory. Jokes may
     be used in selling or in fund-raising, e.g., for political or charitable
     ends.
<BR><BR>[0022] Jokes vary in tone and subject-matter. Not all are equally
     acceptable, though acceptability may depend on the circumstances. Jokes
     about sex or bodily functions (`dirty jokes`) are included within the
     scope of the invention, as are politically incorrect jokes, e.g., racist
     and sexist jokes. Such jokes, according to the invention, may find
     application as acceptable or marginally acceptable `black humour` for use
     in certain circumstances: they may also serve a didactic function.
     However, it is preferred according to the invention that protected jokes
     should not be such as to cause significant offence to any sector of
     society. Where jokes are capable of causing offence, it is a preferred
     feature of the invention to provide a warning of their nature so that
     exposure to them can if desired be avoided.
<BR><BR>[0023] The use of patent rights to protect jokes, though far from obvious,
     can be seen with hindsight to be a natural extension of the system for
     protecting inventions. Technical inventions constitute a `technical
     teaching`: humorous inventions constitute a `humorous teaching`. Specific
     applications of jokes have been discussed above. The utility of a joke
     depends in large manner on how funny it is: that in turn depends greatly
     on whether it is obvious or not. Obvious jokes are rarely funny--nor are
     old jokes. Patent offices are experienced in judging both novelty and
     obviousness, and hence well placed to pass on protection of jokes.
<BR><BR>[0024] It is an additional feature of the invention to file patent
     applications protecting jokes on 1 April. In many countries, the first
     day of April is recognised as a day for performing practical jokes, and
     accordingly it may be regarded as particularly fitting to file patent
     applications protecting jokes on 1 April.
<BR><BR>[0025] The following Examples illustrate the invention in several
     different aspects.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>[0026] This is an example of an adapted joke.
<BR><BR>[0027] A known `shaggy dog` story relates to a cricket-playing horse. The
     anecdote concerns two village cricket teams, one of whom is a player
     short. To make up the numbers, the visiting team asks a horse in a
     neighbouring field if he is willing to help them out. The horse is at
     first reluctant, claiming to be out of practice, but is eventually
     persuaded. The visiting side wins the toss and elects to bat. The horse
     modestly asks to be put in lower down the order, and is chosen to go in
     sixth wicket down, after the team's recognised batsmen. The recognised
     batsmen have a hard time, and, when the horse comes in, six wickets are
     down for 25 runs. As the horse takes guard, it is immediately apparent
     that he knows what he is about, and the first ball is dispatched to the
     boundary. From there on, the fortunes of the visiting team rapidly
     improve. The horse bats with style and vigour, and runs briskly between
     the wickets. The score mounts rapidly, and eventually the visiting side
     is all out for 182, the horse carrying his bat. The home side goes in.
     The visiting captain suggests to the horse that he should open the
     bowling, but he declines. The home side loses two quick wickets, but
     their captain joins one of the openers, and stops the rot. Both batsmen
     gain in confidence, and begin to score freely. At 65 the remaining
     opening bat skies a ball nearly for six, but is spectacularly caught in
     the deep by the horse, running from mid-off round to deep extra cover.
     His successor however settles in rapidly, and soon the score is 100 for
     three. The visiting captain again presses the horse to bowl, but he again
     refuses, politely but firmly. The innings continues. At 122 the captain
     is tempted by a third run, as the horse appears to have misfielded his
     off-drive, but the horse throws in like lightning, throwing down the
     bowler's wicket. Unfortunately, the new man in settles down rapidly, and
     the score is soon mounting again. At 155 the visiting captain is becoming
     desperate. He again approaches the horse, asking him to take an over. The
     horse refuses, with every sign of embarrassment. Eighteen runs are scored
     off the next two overs. At 173 for 4, defeat for the visitors seems
     inevitable. The captain approaches the horse: "Please take this over! If
     you won't, at least tell me why not!" The horse shamefacedly replies: "I
     can't possibly! Did you ever hear of a horse who could bowl?"
<BR><BR>[0028] This and similar jokes are prior art (see for example
     Shakespeare/Fletcher, "The Two Noble Kinsmen", 1614, tennis-playing
     horse). According to the present invention, it is improved by employing
     alliteration in the punch line. Thus the horse may be transposed to a
     bull: "Did you ever hear of a bull who could bowl?" A bear is another
     large mammal that can be effectively substituted. It is also within the
     skill of the art to adapt the joke to other sports, for example,
     baseball: " . . . a puma who could pitch?" (a panther is equally
     effective); or tennis " . . . a vulture who could volley?"; and so on.
     For the alliterative letters, plosives are preferred.
<BR><BR>[0029] This joke is impractical to rehearse.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2
<BR><BR>[0030] The invention in its second aspect is practised as follows. A UK
     patent application for an invention accompanied by a specification
     describing the joke of Example 1 (among others) was filed in the UK
     Patent Office on 30 Aug. 2003, being allotted the official reference
     GB0320419.5. The invention is the joke as set forth in Example 1, and was
     characterised by claims defining it as a joke in which the humour derives
     from accounts of exceptional but partial skill of animals (preferably
     large mammals or birds) in sports involving spheroidal projectiles, in
     which the punch-line relies on alliteration. The patent application is
     maintained. Search and examination are requested. The patent application
     is allowed to publish. Before the end of the Convention year a PCT
     application to protect the invention is filed, claiming priority from the
     UK patent application, and designating all countries for the time being
     members of the PCT. The PCT application is maintained pending as long as
     possible, and then prosecuted to grant or final rejection in a selection
     of designated countries.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3
<BR><BR>[0031] This is an example of a practical joke with a specific commercial
     use. It is adapted to be either recited or rehearsed. The following
     description (a recital of the joke) describes how it can be rehearsed.
<BR><BR>[0032] London Transport's underground railway system (`tube`, Metro) gives
     notice to passengers on its escalators: "Dogs must be carried". However,
     the vast majority of passengers are not accompanied by dogs. The present
     joke consists in supplying this deficit. At least two operators are
     needed. They station themselves one at each end of an escalator, as close
     as possible to the relevant sign. Each displays his or her own sign,
     saying "Get your dog here! Dogs for hire--Only 50p a dog!" "All profits
     to Cancer Relief". Passengers who are willing to contribute pay their
     50p, collect a dog from the first operative, pass down (or up) the
     escalator, return the dog to the second operative, and depart. Each
     operative must be ready to explain to passengers how the scheme works,
     and why it is appropriate for them to hire a dog. It is preferred not to
     use live dogs, as they are more expensive, require careful handling, and
     passengers may sometimes be unwilling to return them. Toy dogs (toys in
     the form of dogs, not toy breeds of dog) are therefore preferred. The
     invention further comprises a kit of parts for rehearsing this joke,
     including at least one (preferably at least two) display placards for
     motivating passengers to hire dogs, at least one set of instructions
     explaining to operators how to rehearse the joke, a plurality of dogs,
     and at least one (preferably at least two) retaining means for retaining
     dogs prior to or after hiring. If live dogs are used, each is preferably
     provided with a leash, and the retaining means may comprise a massive
     body with anchoring means (such as a post, rail or ring) to which leashes
     may be demountably attached. For toy dogs, the retaining means may be a
     container, for example a plastic bin or bag. Collecting boxes are a
     further optional feature of the kit.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 4
<BR><BR>[0033] The invention in its other aspect is practised as follows: A UK
     patent application for the invention, accompanied by a specification
     describing (inter alia) the joke of Example 3, was filed in the UK Patent
     Office on 30 Aug. 2003. The invention is the joke as set forth in Example
     3. The joke was characterised by claims defining it as follows: "In a
     locus in which the behaviour of the public is subject to a promulgated
     rule intended to be conditional, the joke which comprises misinterpreting
     the rule as absolute, and providing means for enabling the public to
     conform to the rule so misinterpreted." Subclaims specified that the
     locus is a public transport system, that the means is provided against
     consideration, and that at least part of that consideration is stated to
     be devoted to charitable causes. Further actions to protect the joke are
     taken as described in Example 1 above.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 5
<BR><BR>[0034] This example relates to a practical joke that is self-referential,
     and may have commercial applications. It consists in the filing of a
     patent application to protect the method of protecting jokes by filing
     one or more patent applications thereon. The invention so defined is
     protected by filing and prosecuting the patent application referred to in
     Examples 2 and 4, and one or more other applications claiming priority
     therefrom. The joke may be either recited or rehearsed, though repeated
     rehearsal may be pointless once the joke becomes public knowledge, unless
     the priority of the initial rehearsal can be claimed.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 6
<BR><BR>[0035] A patent application describing and claiming the jokes set out
     herein in Examples 1-7 was filed at the UK Patent Office on 1 Apr. 2004.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 7
<BR><BR>[0036] Russell (Principles of Mathematics, 1903) divides sets into two
     classes: sets which are members of themselves (for example, the set of
     all sets) and those which are not (for example, the set of all positive
     integers). Following Russell, we may divide patent applications into two
     classes: patent applications which claim themselves, and those which do
     not. We term the former `homoproprietary` and the latter
     `heteroproprietary`. Until now, no patent applications have claimed
     themselves: or to put it another way, the set of homoproprietary patent
     applications has been the null set. However, the present application and
     its predecessors GB0320419.5 and GB0407439.9 claim themselves.
     Accordingly the present invention includes the novel concept of
     homoproprietary patent applications, and provides working examples
     thereof. This is a novel product, or concept, which will have general
     utility. In any patent application it will be possible to include claims
     to the application itself, generically defined. These may prove useful in
     controlling the activities of competitors in the same technical area, by
     preventing them from filing patents of improvement or dependency, for
     example. Objections of non-unity (or in some jurisdictions, different
     areas of search) may require such applications to be amended, restricted
     or divided prior to grant. Such amended applications, and divisionals,
     also form aspects of the invention. Such applications may, by amendment,
     become heteroproprietary, but remain within the scope of the invention so
     long as they claim priority from a homoproprietary patent application.
     Preferred patent applications according to this aspect of the invention
     are regional applications, e.g. PCT applications and European patent
     applications: and applications filed in countries sympathetic to
     `business method patents`, including USA, Japan and Australia.
<BR><BR>[0037] Note that the concept of a homoproprietary patent application is
     intrinsically comic (so Example 7 is an example of a joke that may be
     protected by the process of claim 1), but further specific applications
     of the concept are not necessarily funny.
