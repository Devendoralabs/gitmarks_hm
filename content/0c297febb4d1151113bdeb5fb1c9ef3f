<p align="left">The Media Grid is a computational grid platform that        provides digital media delivery, storage and processing (compute) services for a new generation of        networked applications. <a href="http://mediagrid.org/docs/overview/StandardsIntersection.pdf" target="_blank">Built using Internet and Web standards</a>, the        Media Grid combines Quality of Service (QoS) and broadcast features with        distributed parallel processing capabilities. Together these features        create a unique software development platform designed specifically for        networked applications that produce and consume massive quantities of        digital media. The Media Grid is powered by <a href="http://mediagrid.org/docs/overview/ServiceProviders.pdf" target="_blank">service providers</a> (such as rendering farms, clusters, high-performance computer systems, computational grids, and similar systems) that furnish on-demand services to Media Grid <a href="http://mediagrid.org/docs/overview/Users.pdf" target="_blank">clients (users)</a>. </p>

<p align="justify">As an open and extensible software development and delivery platform the Media Grid is designed to enable a wide range of applications not possible with the traditional Internet and World Wide Web. Applications enabled by the Media Grid include: <a href="http://immersiveeducation.org/" target="_blank">Immersive Education</a>; on-demand digital        cinema and interactive movies; distributed film and movie rendering;        truly immersive multiplayer games and virtual reality; real-time        visualization of complex data (weather, medical, engineering, and so        forth); telepresence and telemedicine (remote surgery, medical imaging, drug        design, etc.); vehicle and aircraft design and simulation; and similar        high-performance media applications.</p>        
<p align="left">The Media Grid is modeled after an improved national power grid, with added security and stability features that eliminate downtime and blackouts. As with the national power grid, which standardizes the production and consumption of power in the United        States, the Media Grid establishes open software standards that enable        computer applications to plug in to digital media delivery and        processing services over the global Internet. Applications that only        need to consume media content or access media processing services can do        so at a fair and standardized price, while the owners of computers that        host and deliver media or provide media processing services receive        compensation for their contribution to the grid.</p>        
        <p align="left">Desktop computers, laptops, handhelds, Personal        Digital Assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, game consoles, and kiosks are        just a few of the many types of computing devices that can tap into the        Media Grid. Devices that have enough computational power can deliver        media content and process media on behalf of other devices in exchange        for credit, meaning some <a href="http://mediagrid.org/docs/overview/Users.pdf" target="_blank">users</a> can earn enough credit to pay for all of        the premium (for-fee) content and services they wish to consume. In contrast, less        power devices can only consume media and services provided by the grid.        Devices that run Media Grid software can be        spontaneously networked together over the traditional Internet to form        ad-hoc grids that exchange media and media processing services. Grids can        also be assembled from specific devices and        administrated much like a traditional managed network... <a href="about.html"><em><strong>&lt;learn more about the Media Grid&gt;</strong></em></a></p>

Starting with 4 classes this fall, the entire Woods College of Advancing Studies course catalog is expected to become fully immersive over the next five years. Standard Boston College credit is issued for immersive Advancing Studies courses, with no distinction made between the amount or form of credit given for traditional in-person classes. Students enrolled in immersive classes attend entirely within an online immersive learning environment, using open and freely available technologies endorsed by the Initiative, and may therefore reside anywhere in the world.</div>

          Some colleges that have built virtual classrooms in Second Lifethe online environment where people walk around as avatars in a cartoonlike worldhave started looking for an exit strategy. The virtual world has not lived up to the hype that peaked in 2007, when just about every day brought a new announcement from a college entering Second Life. Today, disenchanted with commercial virtual worlds but still convinced of their educational value, a few colleges have started to build their own, where they have more control. <strong><em>NOTE: This article presents two official Immersive Education Initiative alternatives to Second Life: OPEN COBALT and OPEN SIMULATOR.

The iED Table dramatically changes the way in which students interact with computer-based learning environments by combining, or 'mixing,' the real world with the virtual world.  Using either a traditional computer display, or by wearing 3D goggles, students can interact physically with a 3D immersive virtual environment that "pops up" from any 2D surface, such as a table, desk, wall, or even the floor. </div>
