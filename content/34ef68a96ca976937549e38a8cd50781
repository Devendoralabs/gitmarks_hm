After falling down a rabbit hole, you seem to have stumbled upon a whole new world.
</p>

<p>
The first hint is the axe wielding man wearing a battered Stetson hat
alongside a fourteen foot ferrotti, battling a horde of cute bunny
rabbits. They fight valiantly, but without hope of success against the
fluffy odds.
</p>

<p>
In a flash of insight you realize you have fallen into the reality of: </p>

<h1 align="center"><em><strong>alt.devilbunnies</strong></em></h1>


<blockquote>"Follow! But! Follow only if ye be men of valor, for the
entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that
no man
yet has fought with it and lived! Bones of four fifty men lie strewn
about its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or
your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty
big pointy teeth."</blockquote>

<h2>What the #%^#*&amp; is a DevilBunny?</h2>

<p>
Well, they are cute and fluffy and found everywhere.
</p>

<h2>Oh. Well, why didn't you say s...NOW WAIT JUST A COTTON PICKING MINUTE, THAT DIDN'T HELP AT ALL!</h2>

<p>Sorry. All sales are final.</p>

<h2>&lt;growl&gt;</h2>

<p>Oh, all right. I'll explain some more. Since you asked so nicely.
(My, what big teeth you have grandma...)
</p>

<h2>&lt;Thwack!&gt;</h2>

<p>
<em>Ouch</em>. That <em>hurt</em>. Tell you what, since there are two
sides to this story, how about you choose which FAQ you want to read:
</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="faq/part1.html"><img src="elmericon.gif" alt="o " align="middle" height="79" hspace="5" width="80">
The Fudd Version</a><a href="faq/part2.html"><img src="dbicon.gif" alt="o " align="middle" height="80" hspace="5" width="80">
The DevilBunny Version</a>
</p>

<p>
Once you have read the FAQ (both of them, I hope...) you can go on and think
about the <a href="faq/part3.html">Ground Rules</a> of the group. Before you go any further, I suggest you read a
<a href="faq/storytime.html" title="Story Time">Story</a> that will, perhaps, help you understand just where the group is coming from.
</p>

<p>
You will also likely want to read the <a href="faq/">Appendixes</a> to the faqs. Yes - all fourteen of them.
</p>

<hr>
<p> Since this <em>is</em> the archive site for alt.devilbunnies, we have
available for your enjoyment, what else but <a href="/cgi-bin/fetch?newsgroup=alt.devilbunnies">the
alt.devilbunnies archives</a>. The archives contain nearly every post to the group since mid-January of 1994. If you heard about the Easter Parade, and
wonder for yourself: Check the archives.
</p>

<p>
Also available are a collection of stories, humor and general fun in
the <a href="text/">Text</a> area; as well as <a href="pictures/">Pictures</a> of the rich and fuzzy (well - fuzzy anyway...) and <a href="sounds/">Sounds</a> of Cuteness in action.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, and by no means least, a pointer to the <a href="news:alt.devilbunnies" name="alt.devilbunnies">alt.devilbunnies</a>newsgroup
itself. (Ha! Thought I had forgotten, didn't you? I'll get you
Dorothy...and your little dog Toto, too! Ah hahahahahhaha...))
