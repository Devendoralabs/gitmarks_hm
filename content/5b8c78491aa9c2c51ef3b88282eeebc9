          <p>From the NMC Website: “The NMC Campus is an experimental effort developed to inform the New Media Consortium’s work in educational gaming. In early 2006, the organization made the decision to create a space for experimentation in a virtual 3-D world and began a search for suitable platforms, with a special interest in massively multi-player environments. Ultimately, Second Life was chosen, and working with an advisory board drawn from its membership, the NMC began designing a space within Second Life expressly to support collaboration, learning, insightful interaction, and experimentation — and to encourage exploration of the potential of virtual environments.  The goal of the project was to create an immersive 3-D virtual environment for higher education and museum professionals to interact, collaborate, and experiment that would provide a low entry threshold for newcomers, while simultaneously exploring the boundaries of what is possible.”</p>

          <p>Abstract: &quot;Virtual worlds are now a reality. Virtual worlds   such as the growing Second Life and Entropia Universe, allow everyone to create   a digital character representing themselves and interact with other   computer-generated individuals, landscapes, and even virtually-run global   businesses in real-time. Fascinatingly, both endogenously produced economies and   social orders are emerging in these virtual worlds. &quot;  </p>
