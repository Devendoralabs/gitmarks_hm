<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 1 -- The Safest Way to Meet an Attack
with
a Spiked Staff or Long Stick when you are only Armed with an Ordinary
Walking
Stick.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">The first photograph shows the most dangerous
mode of attack with a long stick, and also the best position to adopt
in
order to meet such an attack with safety.</font>
</p>
<p><img src="barton-wright/BW2-1_sm.jpg" nosave="" align="left"
 height="632" width="350"></p>
<p><font face="Palatino">It will be seen that the figure on the right
is
exposing his body in order to insure his adversary attacking him there,
and to be prepared with an immediate defence.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Directly the man with the alpenstock attempts
to bayonette him, he diverts the blow by turning sideways, and making a
circular downward cut, which hits the alpenstock and causes it to glide
slightly upwards and sideways -- a guard known in sword play as
"Septime
envelop&eacute;." The moment the blow has been diverted, the man with
the
stick must seize the alpenstock with his left hand, and, stepping in,
strike
his assailant a blow across the face.</font>

</p>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 2. An Effective Way to Defend Oneself
with
a Hooked Stick when Attacked by a Man Armed with an Ordinary Straight
Stick.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">A stick with a curved handle, forming a roomy
crook, although hardly so effective as a stick with a heavy knob on top
for striking purposes, is a most serviceable weapon in the hands of an
expert in the art of stick-play.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Having guarded a blow with a hooked stick, it
is a comparatively simple matter to hook an assailant in such a way
that
he is easily pulled off his balance. With a little practice it becomes
easy to make sure of hooking a man firmly by the neck or leg.</font>
</p>
<p><img src="barton-wright/BW2-2sm.jpg" nosave="" align="left"
 height="887" width="290"><br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Suppose, for instance, that a man carrying a
crooked
stick is suddenly attacked by an assailant armed with an ordinary
straight
stick. Here is a very pretty way to overthrow the assailant:</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">In the first place, the man with the hooked
stick
should hold his hand and stick high up, and well on one side, so as not
to run any risk of being hit on the fingers.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">By doing this, he purposely exposes his head
to
attack. Knowing, therefore, that his opponent is sure to strike at his
head, he is prepared for a quick guard. The attacker delivers his blow
and is received upon the stick; but before he has time to recover
himself,
and get into a position of defence, the other suddenly ducks and hooks
him by the foot, on the outer side of the ankle, bringing him to the
ground
by pulling his legs apart.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">The assailant is then at the mercy of the man
he has attacked, who can choose any part of his body on which to
administer
punishment.</font>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 3. -- The Best Way to Disable a Man who
Tries to Rush You, and get under your Guard, in order to Prevent You
Hitting
him with a Hooked Stick.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">The first photograph shows the best position
to
adopt in order to meet a sudden spring and prevent an assailant from
seizing
your stick.</font>
</p>
<p><img src="barton-wright/BW2-3_sm.jpg" nosave="" align="left"
 height="873" width="284"></p>
<p><font face="Palatino">As a feint, you make a slightly threatening
motion
with your left hand, as though you intended to seize the left hand of
your
assailant, in order to belabor him with your stick. The object of this
feint is only to engage your adversary's attention, and make him look
at
your left hand whilst you suddenly dart your right arm froward, and
hook
him by the neck in the crook of your stick. Directly you have hooked
him,
bend your knees well so as to throw the whole weight of your body upon
him, whilst you pull him with his face towards the ground.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">When you have pulled him down sufficiently far
to prevent him recovering his balance quickly, let go your stick, and
seize
him by the shoulders, as shown in photo No. 4, being careful to keep
your
feet well out of reach of his hands, so as not to give him the
opportunity
of throwing you backwards. Then, with a sudden jerk, pull him forwards,
and simultaneously jumping close into him, strike him with your knee in
the face.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">It is necessary to be very careful when
practising
this trick, as the slightest blow with the knee in a person's face is
sufficient
to break a nose and several teeth.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Of course the reader will understand that in
any
method of self-defence it is necessary to know how to maintain the
proper
distance between yourself and your assailant, in order to deliver a <i>coup-de-gr&acirc;ce</i>
with effect and certainty. This knowledge, together with the
confidence,
dash, and <i>savoir-faire</i> that are so essential, can only be
acquired
by practice; but, when once gained, it is never lost.</font>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 4. -- How to Use a Walking-Stick as a
Weapon
in a Crowd.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">It will be understood that it is quite
impossible
to swing a stick in a crowd, owing to want of elbow room; and so, in
order
to get elbow room and free scope to hit, you proceed as follows: --</font>
</p>
<p><img src="barton-wright/BW2-4_sm.jpg" nosave="" align="left"
 height="488" width="350"></p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Hold your stick, more or less in a line with
your
hips, and proceed, as in the second photograph, to lunge to your left,
holding the end of the stick in your right hand, and letting it slide
through
your left, in order to be able to guide it with certainty.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Lunging at the body of the nearest man on your
left, you disable him, and cause him to retreat precipitously. In doing
so, he involuntarily forces back those in his immediate neighborhood.
You
then turn on your heels, and bayonette the nearest man on your right,
this
time holding the end of your stick in your left hand, and guiding it
through
your right. Directly you have bayonetted him, and caused him to force
back
others in his attempt to escape, you make a quarter turn on your heels,
and bayonette the man behind you.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">After this, seeing another man close to him
with
his legs slightly apart, you make a dive with your stick between his
legs,
and upset him. Take one step backwards, and you should now have
sufficient
room to swing your stick to right and left across people's faces and
heads
until they disperse.</font>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 5. -- A very Simple Way to Protect
Yourself
with a Hooked Walking Stick against a Boxer.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">When carrying a hooked stick, here is a very
simple
way to protect yourself against the attack of an unarmed assailant.</font>
</p>
<p><img src="barton-wright/BW2-5_sm.jpg" nosave="" align="left"
 height="857" width="341"></p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Hold your stick behind you, as seen in the
first
photograph, so as to run no risk of the stick-arm being seized. Bend
your
left arm with the inside of the left hand facing outwards in order to
protect
yourself from a kick at the hip, or a blow from the fist at your face
or
ribs.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">In the photographs it will be seen that the
boxer
has chosen the attack at his opponent's face. To meet such an attack
safely,
you must put your head well on ones side, and bend both your knees very
considerably at the moment when the boxer leads off, so as to get well
under his guard. Directly you receive the blow upon your arm, you must
straighten your knees, and so throw up the boxer's arm, and make him
lose
his balance, which prevents him from using his right fist upon your
ribs.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">You have now the opportunity, and plenty of
time,
to hook him by the ankle with your stick, as seen in the second
photograph.
Having so hooked his foot, pull his legs apart, and bring him to the
ground,
when you can apply the stick where and how you please.</font>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 6. -- How to Overcome the Advantage of
an Assailant who Attacks You with a Stout Stick when You are Carrying
only
a Light Cane.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">When threatened with an attack from an
assailant
who is armed with a superior stick to your own, it is wise to attack
him
before he realises that he has you at a disadvantage.</font>
</p>
<p><img src="barton-wright/BW2-6_sm.jpg" nosave="" align="left"
 height="916" width="338"></p>
<p><font face="Palatino">To do so to the best effect you should lead
off
with aright-handed blow at your assailant's head, thereby forcing him
to
guard high. At the same moment you should jump in one movement from the
position shown by the figure to the left of photo No. 2 to the position
shown by the same figure in photo No. 3 -- a very simple and easy
movement.
In making this spring you must be careful to keep your head down and on
one side.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">As soon as you are in the position shown in
photo
No. 3, without making any attempt to lift your adversary in order to
throw
him, simply strike your knee smartly against the back of his knee; this
will have the effect of knocking his leg from beneath him. As he reels
about on his left leg trying to regain his balance, put plenty of force
into your left arm, and throw him upon the back of his head. He will
immediately
put out both his hands to try to break his fall, and in so doing will
drop
his stick.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">In this way you accomplish your purpose and
disarm
your adversary. You can now give him his <i>coup-de-gr&acirc;ce</i> as
you please. The surest way is to deal him a blow across his ankle or
just
below the knee.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">I must caution anyone who attempts this trick
upon a friend to be very gentle when pushing with the left arm to
effect
the throw, otherwise it is likely that the friend upon whom the
experiment
is tried will be rendered unconscious or otherwise seriously injured.
The
throw described is a very strong and dangerous one if properly
delivered.</font>

</p>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 7. -- Another Way, when Armed with a
Light
Cane, to Disarm and Overpower an Opponent who carries a Superior Stick.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Suppose once again that, when carrying only a
light cane, you are attacked by an assailant armed with a stronger and
more serviceable stick. In order to rob him of his advantage you
immediately
proceed as described in the last example by aiming a high blow at your
opponent's head, thus causing him to guard high.</font>
</p>
<p><img src="barton-wright/BW2-7_sm.jpg" nosave="" align="left"
 height="406" width="350"><br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Now spring in one bound under his guard to the
position shown in photo No. 2. Passing your left hand over his right
forearm,
placing your right hand against his wrist, and at the same time seizing
your own right wrist in your left hand, you thus firmly "lock" your
adversary's
arm. All this is done without loosening the hold upon your own stick,
and
without seizing your opponent's arm in any way with your hand -- yet
the
lock is so powerful that the strongest man would be a child in your
hands
when you properly apply the leverage you may obtain from this position.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">To apply the leverage correctly, you should
force
your opponent's elbow towards you with your left arm, and at the same
time
force his right hand downwards and from you, with the "lock" formed by
your left hand in holding your right wrist.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">The pain and strain from this grip is so
excruciating
that your opponent will fall upon his back, only too thankful thus to
escape
the danger of a broken arm. He is then at your mercy, and you may apply
your stick or your foot, as circumstances may dictate.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">This, and the preceding method of self-defense
with a walking-stick, may be practised upon a swordsman armed with a
sword
or a dagger with absolute certainty of success. Personally, I have
tried
one or other of these examples time after time against good swordsmen,
and have never failed to bring the trick through successfully. Of
course,
your success, or otherwise, will depend to some extent upon the
quickness,
dash, and power with which you execute the assault.</font>

</p>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 8. -- One of the Best Ways to Meet a
Direct
Attack upon the Head with a very Heavy Stick when Armed with an
Ordinary
Stick.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">The first photograph shows a man armed with a
heavy stick in the act of striking at the head of a man armed with a
walking-stick.
The latter is standing in the double-handed position of guard; and it
will
be noticed that in holding his weapon he places his hands so that the
back
of his left hand is on the side nearest his face, and the back of his
right
hand on the side farthest from his face; in other words, the positions
of his hands are reversed.</font>
</p>
<p><img src="barton-wright/BW2-8_sm.jpg" nosave="" align="left"
 height="532" width="350"></p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Directly the assailant delivers his blow, the
man with the walking-stick slides his stick through his right hand
until
has hands meet, and then twists the stick without altering his hold in
any way so that his right hand passes over his left. In this position,
with his wrists crossed, he holds the stick above his head, to receive
the downward cut delivered by his adversary.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Directly he has guarded the blow, and so
broken
the force of it, letting go the stick with the left hand, with this
hand
he seizes the assailant's staff. Retaining hold of the stick with his
right
hand, the man attacked may then break his opponent's wrist with a heavy
blow, as seen in Photograph No. 3. Another method is to let the blow
fall
across the assailant's kneecap, as seen in photograph No. 4.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Still another way to proceed is for the man
attacked
to continue to use his own weapon with both hands, and to deliver a
heavy
blow across his adversary's face, as shown in the last photograph.</font>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 9. -- A very Serviceable Way to Disable
a Taller Man than Yourself when Opposed to Him under Unequal Conditions.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Directly you have had time to catch your
opponent's
eye and judge your striking distance, you must expose your head, either
by slightly lowering your guard, or by holding your hand and stick well
on one side, so as to invite an attack on your head. You must rely on
your
own quickness to protect your head when the blow falls.</font>
</p>
<p><img src="barton-wright/BW2-9_sm.jpg" nosave="" align="left"
 height="496" width="350"></p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Directly your opponent sees the opening, he
will
lead off at your head. You protect yourself by receiving the blow upon
your stick, as seen in the first photograph. Then, without losing any
time,
drop into the next position, and bayonette your assailant over the
heart.</font>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 10. -- Example of a very Pretty Guard
and
Counter-blow when an Assailant Directs a Blow at your Head with a Stick.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">When an assailant attempts to strike you on
the
head with his stick, you may receive the blow upon your stick by
bringing
your hand right across your face, and holding it well on the left side
of your head with the back of your hand outwards, facing your opponent.
Your stick should point slightly downwards to prevent your opponent's
stick
sliding down yours, and striking you on the fingers. The moment you
have
done this you step slightly towards your opponent's right side with
your
right foot, and describe a circular right to left back-handed cut
across
his face, which should be sufficient to prevent him troubling you any
further.</font>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial">No. 11. -- An Example of the Double-Handed
Guard in Combination with Ambi-Dexterity.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">In this example the man on the left in the
photograph
is seen taking up the double handed guard, but his assailant refuses to
accept the invitation at his body, although it is exposed -- instead of
this he aims a blow at the left wrist, or the left side of the head. On
this the man with the double-handed guard, in order to avoid being hit
upon the fingers, lets go of the left-hand end of his stick, and swings
his left hand behind him -- a movement which automatically imparts the
initial movement for a right-handed blow. This he delivers across his
opponent's
wrist, which he would thus break, just as the assailant is in the act
of
striking.</font>

<b><i><font face="Arial">No. 12. -- Another Example of the
Double-Handed
Guard in Combination with Ambi-Dexterity.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">In this example, the defender, as in No. 11,
invites
an attack at his body by guarding his head in an exaggerated way, and
so
exposing his body. His opponent immediately attempts to take advantage
of the opening by striking at the exposed body, when the other simply
draws
his left foot towards his right, and so retires out of striking
distance
of his adversary. Then, by releasing his hold on the stick down heavily
with his left upon his assailant's head, as seen in the lowest
photograph.</font>

</p>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">Concluding Note.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">With reference to the short description of
walking-stick
play, and the tricks described in this and the preceding number of <i>Pearson's</i>,
I may state that the art of self-defence with a walking-stick is
particularly
adapted to conditions where a man is attacked by more than one person.
It can be readily acquired, either by men or women, and when once
mastered
would enable you to defend yourself, with absolute safety, against a
knife,
boxing, savate, etc. The more dangerous methods have not been shown.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Palatino">Besides being a most useful and practical
accomplishment,
this new art of self-defence with a walking-stick is to be recommended
as a most exhilarating and graceful exercise.</font>
