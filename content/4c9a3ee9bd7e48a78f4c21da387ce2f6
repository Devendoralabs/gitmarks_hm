<p class="subhead">What is it?</p>
      <p> CamStudio is able to record all screen and audio activity on your computer
        and create industry-standard AVI video files and using its built-in
        SWF Producer can turn those AVIs into lean, mean, bandwidth-friendly
        Streaming Flash videos (SWFs) </p>
      <p>Here are just a few ways you can use this software:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can use it to create demonstration videos for any software program</li>
        <li><strong>Or how about creating a set of videos answering your most
            frequently asked questions?</strong></li>
        <li>You can create video tutorials for school or college class</li>
        <li><strong>You can use it to record a recurring problem with your computer
            so you can show technical support people</strong></li>
        <li>You can use it to create video-based information products you can <span class="style2">sell</span></li>
        <li>You can even use it to record new tricks and techniques you discover
          on your favourite software program, before you forget them</li>
      </ul>

            <p>&#8220;I am a self-employed consultant
              that works in the public safety community (cops, fire, ems, dispatch etc). What I have planned is to use CamStudio to capture on screen video for 
              training vids.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Thanks for a great product and your help!&#8221;</p>

      <p class="subhead">Don't like the sound of your voice? No problem.</p>
      <p>CamStudio can also add high-quality, anti-aliased (no jagged edges)
        screen captions to your recordings in seconds and with the unique Video
        Annotation feature you can even personalise your videos by including
        a webcam movie of yourself &quot;picture-in-picture&quot;
        over your desktop.</p>
      <p>And if all that wasn't enough, CamStudio also comes with its own Lossless
        Codec that produces crystal clear results with a much smaller filesize
        compared with other more popular codecs, like Microsoft Video 1.</p>
      <p>You have total control over the output of your video: you can choose
        to use custom cursors, to record the whole screen or just a section of
        it and can reduce or increase the quality of the recording depending
        on if you want smaller videos (for emailing to people, for instance)
        or you can have &quot;best quality&quot; ones for burning onto CD/DVD.</p>
      <p>But all of these features would be worthless if CamStudio wasn't easy
        to use ... fortunately that's not the case. CamStudio can be learned
        in a matter of minutes and comes with a comprehensive built-in helpfile,
        so if you <strong>do</strong> manage to get stuck, you can simply hit &quot;Help&quot; and
        get the answers you need.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="subhead">So where can I get it and how much does it cost?</p>
      <p>You can download and use it completely free - yep - completely 100%
        free for your personal and commercial projects as CamStudio and the Codec
        are released under the GPL (for more details on this license, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">click
        here</a>.) </p>
      <p>There are no royalties or any monies to pay - although if you do use
        it for a commercial product, I wouldn't say no to a copy of whatever
        you produce <img src="images/smilie.gif" width="15" height="15"></p>

      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="subhead">CamStudio's History </span></p>
      <p>Over the last few months, quite a people have asked me about CamStudio's
        history and the confusion with the V2.1 that's around, so I thought I'd
        explain what the situation is, as I understand it ...</p>
      <p>CamStudio was originally released by a company called RenderSoft who
        were subsequently bought by a company called eHelp who used some of the
        technology in their program, RoboDemo ...</p>
      <p>Some time later, eHelp was bought by Macromedia who wanted RoboDemo
        (which was to become Captivate) ...</p>
      <p>Knowing that CamStudio did some of the stuff RoboDemo did for free (mainly
        export to streaming Flash), it looks like they released a newer version
        of CamStudio (2.1) which fixed some bugs but most importantly, removed
        certain features. Gone was the ability to create SWFs, added was the
        requirement to register to use it, and over time, links to the various
      webpages that had CamStudio and its source code, became broken.</p>
      <p>However, I've managed to find the earlier version 2.0 complete with
        the related CamStudio video codec (comparable to Techsmith's excellent
        TSCC), the source code for both and just put the website up so people
        can download them ...</p>

      <p class="subhead">Issues</p>
      <p>A number of people have mentioned having trouble viewing SWF videos
        generated by CamStudio. It turns out there's a bug which means you can't
        see anything if you try watching them with Netscape or Firefox (Internet
        Explorer works fine) ...</p>
      <p>The next update (2.5) will fix this but until then, here's a temporary
        workaround:</p>
      <table width="500" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#0000CC" bgcolor="#DFF4FF">
        <tr>
          <td><p class="style8">Open the related HTML to the SWF you've just
              generated and look for the line starting with the &quot;<strong>EMBED
              SRC</strong>&quot; command ...</p>
              <p class="style8">Change the Width and Height values in this line
                to match values in the line starting with &quot;<strong>OBJECT
                CLASSID</strong>&quot;.</p>
            <p class="style8">Save the file and you should be good to go ... </p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>I seem to be getting a lot of questions about a registration
        code ... the version of CamStudio available from this site (v2.0) doesn't
        require registration AND has more features, so uninstall v2.1 from your
      system, download and install v2.0 from here and you're good to go! </p>
      <p>If your computer's memory or virtual memory usage starts climbing rapidly
        when viewing a SWF authored by CamStudio to the point when your PC locks
        up so you have to reboot it, recreate the SWF from your source AVI file
        and in SWF Producer, make sure you select the Advanced tab and check
        the Memory Management tickbox (Manage Flash player internal memory).
        That should sort the problem out. <strong>Thanks to Ben Ward for the fix.</strong> </p>

      <p><span class="subhead">A Plea For Help ...</span>      
      <p>I've got big plans
        for CamStudio and want to continously improve it and the Codec as well
        ... but I'm not a programmer.</p>
      <p>The potential for CamStudio to be used as a professional training and
        support tool is huge and not just in the information technology and internet
        marketing arenas, but also in diverse markets and tasks like home eduation,
        recording online geneological research, keeping a video record of special
        offer prices on your favourite snowboarding (or whatever) website - you
        get the idea ... <img src="images/smilie.gif" width="15" height="15"></p>
      <p>It  doesn't matter if you're at home in Las Vegas
        or on an Alaskan Cruise - if you've got a laptop or PC you can use CamStudio. </p>
      <p>So if there are any Visual C++ programmers
      out there that have Flash, video encoding and codec experience who'd like
      a challenge, please get in touch. </p>
      <p>So, at some point in the near future I'd like to start accepting donations
        so any coders that work on this project will get some kind of financial
        reward in addition to the warm, fuzzy feeling they get from helping to
        resurrect this cracking piece of software ... so if you're feeling generous,
        please get in touch at the email address above and let me know. </p>      
      <p>I'd also love to get your feedback on CamStudio ... what you liked,
        what you thought sucked and what you think is missing.</p>
