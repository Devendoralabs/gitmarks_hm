<p>Mpire continues to do some super compelling work in the ad optimization space.  I do have a vested <a href="http://www.adxpose.com/about/board.page" target="_blank">interest </a>in the company but that does not address the fundamental fact that this market is exploding.</p>
<p>Some excellent proof points can be found in a study that was conducted by Mpire and Radar Research.  They teamed up to conduct the first ever market survey on the verifcication and optimizaiton market.  The report has a lot of interesting information for brands, agencies, and publishers.  You can check it out <a href="http://www.startupwhisperer.com/www.adxpose.com/whitePapers.page" target="_blank">here</a>.  Some key takeawyas from the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respondents who plan to spend part of their overall media budget on ad verification and optimization, on average, plan to spend 2.3%.  Over $200M dollars in the next year from nascent the year before.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>in 2011 (an increase of more than 140% from 2010). This makes the verification space a rapdily growing market when one thins about 2.3% applied to the $10.12B display market.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>More than 70% of respondents say marketers and agencies paid for verification in 2010, but that number will drop to 56% in 2011, with publishers and networks picking up the bill for the difference.</li>
<li>Advertisers expect CPM ads to be viewable.  The days of selling below the fold and never-viewed ads are fading fast.  Respondents rated InView impressions as the most important optimization metric provided by ad verification companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I think the most compelling stat is that 80% of the respondents strongly agree that verification is good for the online ad industry.  Aka there is going to be more demand for verification in the coming years.</p>

<p><em><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-441" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1ex 1.5em;" title="TRTTT_logo_medium" src="http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/TRTTT_logo_medium.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="307" />This is a guest post by David Garland, author of a new book: </em><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Faster-Cheaper-Non-Boring-Fluff-Free/dp/0470647922">Smarter, Faster, Cheaper</a>: Non-Boring, Fluff-Free Strategies For Marketing &amp; Promoting Your Business.</em></p>
<p><em>Some of this advice is new, some sounds obvious in retrospect, but it&#8217;s always good hearing what works from someone who came from nowhere and it making it happen. </em></p>
<p>Two years ago I started my website <a href="http://www.therisetothetop.com/">The Rise To The Top</a> in October 2008. The goal was to create a non-boring resource for entrepreneurs centered around a combination of video interviews (RISE&#8230;the web show) with successful entrepreneurs, big thinkers and &#8220;doers&#8221; (as opposed to people that <strong>just</strong> talk about doing) as well as blog posts, videos and other goodies.</p>
<p>Of course, like many of us, I really had no idea what I was doing. I constantly tried different things, had some lonely days (weeks, months) in the beginning, but eventually things started to click. I want to share this story with you to show you that this can be done by any hustling entrepreneur looking to grow a community and following. I’m no more special than you (even though my mom told me so) and the principles below I bet you can apply to your business and online strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the raw facts, then I&#8217;ll explain exactly how I did it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Snapshot Of The Beginning In Fall 2008:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Total viewership: My dad, mom and grandma. Maybe a few random friends.</li>
<li>About 500 Facebook friends, mostly folks from high school, college and random friends.</li>
<li>Every post I would put up would have an average of one comment.</li>
<li>Zero media appearances in traditional media. None. Zippo. Or really any connections for media.</li>
<li>I’d never really hosted an offline event before.</li>
<li>I invested my own money to get everything going&#8230;basically funded by my Bar Mitzvah plus some random savings.</li>
<li>I didn’t know any influential entrepreneurs, authors or really anyone that interesting in the business world.</li>
<li>I had just started with Twitter and had 4 followers.</li>
<li>No connections with big bloggers or online influencers.</li>
<li>My marketing &#8220;budget&#8221; was a whopping $0.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fast Forward To The End Of 2010 (Two Years Later):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RISE now gets over 100,000 viewers per month on the website, iTunes and other formats (including a TV app) plus thousands of subscribers who subscribe to daily and weekly updates.</li>
<li>Facebook has ballooned to over 5,500 friends/fans (on a personal page and fan page)</li>
<li>Most RISE posts now averages thousands of views plus tons of comments, shares on Facebook/Twitter, etc.</li>
<li>I’ve been blessed to have snuck into the media over 100 times including ABC, CNN, CBC, The Wall Street Journal, Bnet and more.</li>
<li>Since 2008, I’ve hosted 25 events ranging from Dinners and Discussions to Lunch &amp; Learns bringing people I’ve met in the online world to offline.</li>
<li>The website became profitable in less than one year (top revenue source: sponsorships) and other opportunities also popped up including speaking gigs, consulting and a book deal with Wiley Publishing.</li>
<li>I’ve been fortunate to interview over 275 interesting people ranging from marketing master Seth Godin to the author of The 4-Hour Workweek Tim Ferriss and a whole slew of others. More important than the interviews, I’ve been able to strike up real relationships with all the guests.</li>
<li>Although numbers aren’t everything (obviously), I’m VERY fortunate (and flattered) to have over 25,000 people follow me on Twitter and more important than pure numbers, interactions with hundreds on a daily basis.</li>
<li>I’ve had the opportunity to write a monthly column for Small Biz Trends as well as periodic guest posts on sites such as Personal Branding Blog and Hubspot’s Internet Marketing Blog.</li>
<li><strong>My marketing budget is still $0.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Why did I tell you this? Is it shameless bragging? (Well, yes, that too.)</p>
<p>Did I get really lucky? Not really.</p>
<p>Spend a lot of money? Nope.</p>
<p>Bribe people? Nope.</p>
<p>Most importantly, can you do something like this in your own way? Absolutely. Here are some of the lessons learned:</p>
<p><strong>#1: It Starts With Being A Media Source &amp; Creating Interesting Content </strong></p>
<p>It all starts with the content you create and post on your home base (blog, interactive website). And keeping in mind what spreads and what doesn’t. Think about what you share with others on a daily basis. What do you pass on it? Normally it falls into three overlapping categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational aka &#8220;Interesstttingggggg&#8230;.&#8221;</li>
<li>Entertaining aka &#8220;LOL&#8221;</li>
<li>Inspiring aka &#8220;I’m pumped up to take on the world.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>These might seem obvious, but look at most blog posts (from unsuccessful blogs) and you&#8217;ll notice how almost none fo the posts manages to be one of these three things.  It&#8217;s rarer than it should be.</p>
<p>What do people <em>not</em> share?</p>
<ul>
<li>Overt marketing messages (when is the last time you passed on a banner ad to friends or some kind of sales crap?)</li>
<li>Boring content: &#8220;Hey Jim, check out this blog post&#8230;really boring!&#8221;</li>
<li>Stuff that is hard to share: You can’t expect people to take too many steps to share something. One or two clicks maximum will increase the ability for others to share 1000% or more. Make it painless.</li>
<li>Walled Content: Nothing wrong with paid content, but when it comes to building an audience and community, it is hard to spread content behind a paywall or any kind of wall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here again, perhaps the most important part is not being boring. Heck, even overt ads will, in fact, be shared when they&#8217;re not boring (for example the Old Spice guy). And again, it&#8217;s amazing how difficult it is to not be boring — saying something new &#8220;enough&#8221; that it&#8217;s interesting, a writing style that moves along and entertains, relatable stories, and so on.</p>
<p>Put it this way, instead of asking &#8220;How wide the audience for this post,&#8221; ask &#8220;Will some people find this super-interesting.&#8221;  Instead of asking &#8220;Is this post long (or short) enough,&#8221; ask &#8220;Will some people find this immensely compelling.&#8221;  Instead of asking &#8220;Is this content unique enough,&#8221; ask &#8220;Will some people be swayed by my arguments here.&#8221;</p>
<p>My strategy was pretty simple with RISE: Create interesting video interviews with unique people. Plus supplementing with non-boring articles, video blogs and other content. And focus design on simplicity of sharing. Over time, like Novocain, it works.</p>
<p><strong>#2: Unique Positioning: </strong></p>
<p>I get this question a lot: <em>&#8220;If everyone can create content, how do you stick out from the pack?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Fair question. How do you stick out?</p>
<p>Here are a few ways:</p>
<p>#1: It&#8217;s cliche I know, but the more passionate you are, the better. And passion makes you stick out. A person who is &#8220;just creating content because it is their job&#8221; will lose to the person who actually gives a crap. Because creating a community and audience takes effort (as well as a tiny bit of blood, a lot of sweat and tears). Passion and excitement are consistent and infectious.</p>
<p>#2: Personality. People gravitate to personalities much more than faceless brands. And I’m not talking about &#8220;holier than thou gurus&#8221; or some other queeze-worthy phrase of the moment. I’m talking about people that educate, entertain and or inspire. A human face. We are in the midst of the rise of personal publishing and people latch on to people and ideas.</p>
<p>#3: Video. Creating video separates you from the pack, especially authentic &#8220;real&#8221; video as opposed to scripted garbage. Why? Because next to face-to-face nothing can create a &#8220;know, like, trust&#8221; relationship (vitally important) as video. And no need to fret over the technology or fear of being on camera. The tech is getting easier by the day and the fear goes away with practice.</p>
<p>Bottom line is worry less about what the competition is doing and focus on what you want to do.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about how much better you are than X, or whether you&#8217;re different enough from Y, but just whether you are doing something compelling yourself.</p>
<p><strong>#3: Consistency &amp; Commitment Wins</strong></p>
<p>This is a important and something that might be the most critical aspect of building an audience. Consistent effort and commit effort wins over time. You can create your own rules of engagement as long as they are consistent to some extent.</p>
<p>For example, Seth Godin posts EVERY single day of the week. It is a short thought-provoking post usually, in text. He also answers every single non-anonymous email sent to him.</p>
<p>Gary Vaynerchuk posts a new episode of Wine Library TV every Monday-Friday. He also is feverish in social media and in the comments section being helpful, answering questions, etc.</p>
<p>Chris Guillebeau posts thoughts on travel and not-conforming every Tuesday and Saturday. You can also hunt him down easily on Twitter where you can find him interacting.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[Editor's note: And I, different from each of those guys, publish 0.5 to 1 times per week, and long articles instead of short. The format can literally be anything.]</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Heck, even &#8220;being inconsistent&#8221; can be consistent. Tim Ferriss posts on the The 4-Hour Workweek Blog at seemingly random times and random frequencies (trust me, Tim has a reason for everything he does). But, each post is long and just jam packed with information (super meaty and as Tim told me in an interview, his goal is to create &#8220;evergreen&#8221; content that is as useful a month or a year from now than it is the moment he posts it). Plus, Tim DOES share interesting links/content almost everyday on Twitter. That is consistent.</p>
<p>Here are some of my &#8220;rules&#8221; which have been tweaked and adjusted over time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Post great stuff five days a week: M-F</li>
<li>Tuesday and Thursday are new web shows/interviews. Monday, Wednesday, Friday are blog posts, videos and other random stuff.</li>
<li>Every post is posted to Twitter and Facebook.</li>
<li>I do my very best to answer every email that comes to me, every @reply on Twitter, every note on Facebook. I understand this is not scalable, but this is how I’ve done it.</li>
<li>I also do my best to respond to all comments on each post.</li>
<li>I try to comment on at least 2-3 blogs a day in my niche and share other people’s great content as well.</li>
<li>If I mention someone in a post, I make sure to email them and tell them about it (I never ask that they help promote it, but they often do).</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this time consuming? Absolutely. Is it worth it? You bet.</p>
<p>The thing is, it does take some patience. Sort of like a weight loss program, it isn’t about a quick fix, but effort over time. You can’t see the results right away just like you don’t lost 50 pounds right away, but if you keep plugging away and going at it&#8230; good things happen.</p>
<p>In fact, this one point alone is often what separates the successful folks from the rest. When you&#8217;re not seeing progress, when you&#8217;ve been at it for months and months, it&#8217;s easy to get discouraged and stop, so that&#8217;s what almost everyone does.</p>
<p><strong>4: One-On-One Human Relationships</strong></p>
<p>This is another element of the secret sauce to building a community. Getting in the trenches and getting to know people. Who do you need to know?</p>
<p>Examples might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>People that would be interested in the content you create (aka enthusiasts).</li>
<li>Bloggers and other media creators in your niche (could be opportunities to team up and help each other, guest blogging and other goodies).</li>
<li>Traditional media that covers your area of interest broadly and specifically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nice thing about technology is it is bringing us closer together and you are probably just a few clicks away from meeting anyone you want. But, you have make the conscious effort especially early on to get yourself out there. Shoot emails to people and introduce yourself. Help people out by sharing THEIR content. Become a part of other communities in your niche. Whatever it takes.</p>
<p>The people that do this the best don’t have a manipulative hidden agenda (I will make you my friend and then use you&#8230;muhahahaha) and also build relationships before they need them. Meaning, it is a bad idea to email someone and say, &#8220;Hi, Jake. Love your blog. I have a new product coming out next week called ‘The World’s Awesomest E-Book Ever In The History Of Ever&#8230;Ever’ can you promote it for me? Thanks!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yuck. Get out there. Online and off. Get to know people. Help them. And karma comes back along. Remember, content creators and those walking and talking have a special place in people’s hearts and earn a lot of respect.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[Editor's note: In the comments on this blog and in general, people are constantly saying "I have this business idea but I don't have a network so I can't get advice and I can't get my first 20 customers. What do I do?" There're many answers, but one of the most obvious is what David is saying here — build your network before you need it, because it takes time!  You have the power to not be in that situation.]</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>#5: Taking It Offline</strong></p>
<p>Has social media and Internet completely changed the game when it comes to connected with people and building a community? You betcha. Is it the end-all-be-all and can we forget about &#8220;offline&#8221; and &#8220;face-to-face&#8221;&#8230; no way.</p>
<p>Still, nothing quite beats face to face relationships. Sure, you can’t have them with <em>everyone</em> you meet online, but you have to get out from behind the computer and bring those online relationships offline and offline relationships online.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Getting to hang out with someone face-to-face is memorable. And you can continually stay in touch with people online afterward.</p>
<p>How might you do this? Besides of course hanging out at conferences and events in your niche (the hallways are where the real relationships are formed), why not bring people together in your home town for a lunch or dinner? There is massive brand building power in bringing people together.</p>
<p>Since 2008, I’ve hosted 25 events ranging from 20-150 people and while it took a fair amount of effort, the overhead was minimal (meaning it wasn’t like putting on a massive conference) and results were more solid relationships. This past year I hosted lunches for 50-or-so forward-thinkers to come together, hang out, enjoy some food and take in and participate in three interactive mini-talks with special guests. It was a lot of fun. And photos, videos and live tweets from the event made it much more than just a two hour experience. The Internet never forgets.</p>
<p><strong>#6: Respecting The Blogger &amp; Traditional Media By Positioning Yourself As A Trusted Resource</strong></p>
<p>Positioning yourself as a trusted resource on a variety of topics can do a whole heck of a lot of good when it comes to building a following. Why? Because you can create a fantastic triangle.</p>
<ol>
<li>The blogger or new media source gets great content from you (makes their job easier).</li>
<li>You get your smiling face in front of THEIR audience/community.</li>
<li>If your content is great, you will attract new people into your community.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweet.</p>
<p>The key to think about as you create your own content is WHAT topics can you talk about with confidence? What are a few broad topics (remember traditional media is a bit more broad) and what are some uber-specific topics? Here is the (partial) way I would answer that myself:</p>
<p>Broad Topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Online Marketing</li>
<li>Generating Buzz</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific Topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building An Audience/Community</li>
<li>Becoming Your Own Media Source</li>
<li>Maximizing Online Video</li>
<li>Turning Passion/Interests Into Money</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is finding needs to reach out to reporters/bloggers as a trusted resource and not a product pusher. Again, this isn’t about press releases but knowing the source and offering up something helpful. A guest post works equally well with online and offline sources because journalists, editors, and bloggers are <em>always</em> under the gun to produce more content, and if you&#8217;re supplying them with something good you&#8217;re making their jobs easier.</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping It Up &amp; Learning More: </strong></p>
<p>Of course like on those annoying infomercials (Lose 20 Pounds In 3 Minutes!!!!) there is that fine print: Your results might vary.</p>
<p>Unlike those infomercials, this is realistic. We all have opportunities now to create communities, audiences and a following. And you can start right now.</p>

<div><span class="articleText"><span class="articleText">Lately, we have seen an increase in two  requests from event organizers: send a customer to speak instead of you  and/or speak for free. While made with the best of intentions, these  requests are at the very least rude and at worst portray organizations  as unprofessional. Why are these seemingly innocuous requests rude?Mack Collier of The Viral Garden has articulated why it is wrong to ask  experts to speak for free, saying that good speakers spend days creating material and preparing for a presentation. He estimated that he spends  &#8220;anywhere from 15 to 30 hours preparing/rehearsing the presentation, and loses a minimum of one day due to travel, usually two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a big investment of time for anyone &#8212; and for experts, time is  money. A good event organizer will not ask a speaker to speak for free  and they will cover travel costs. Speakers understand the need to offset costs by giving speaking slots to sponsors. But sponsors are  advertisers. Just because someone paid for a sponsorship doesn&#8217;t mean  they have the expertise you need.</p>
<p>As someone who has organized numerous events, my goal is to secure  speakers who provide the expertise participants will benefit from. The  speaker&#8217;s expertise should be lending credibility and value to your  event. Framing the event as a business development opportunity for the  speaker is unprofessional; the reason to select speakers is for the  value they bring to your program. A good speaker is not there to make a  sales pitch; rather, to educate, entertain, and/or motivate the  audience.</p>
<p>The second request is to substitute a customer as an expert. The  underlying message is &#8220;you are good enough to do the work for a company  but not good enough to speak at our event.&#8221; This request places the  experts and their customers in a very difficult situation &#8212; who pays  for the customer&#8217;s travel since many companies&#8217; travel budgets have  become restrictive, who prepares the presentation, who preps the  customer since they are not experts, how do they handle Q&amp;A&#8217;s, what  if a company commitment comes up and they need to bail, and so on.</p>
<p>This kind of request often results in the experts paying travel for both the customer and themselves, preparing the presentation since the  customer doesn&#8217;t have the time or expertise, and having do a dive and  catch when the customer has a last-minute schedule conflict. It also  creates schedule challenges for dry runs, which can negatively impact  the event attendees&#8217; experience.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that this particular request creates an enormous  amount of work and additional costs for the experts and additional work  for their customers with no payoff for either party. In today&#8217;s  environment, customers want to use their limited resources to reach  their prospects and customers, to grow their businesses. Their time is  money, too, and they want to invest where they will see the best return.</p>
<p>If you want to be a better event organizer, stop making these two  requests of the experts who can add tremendous value to your event.</p>

<p>Demand Side Platforms really took off in 2010.  If you are in the advertising industry then you have undoubtedly heard of DSPs.  These networks are similar to the traditional “supply-side” ad networks where publishers supply impressions for resale to agencies where the demand resides. The demand side is driven from the large media agencies and technology providers in part because buying online display for agencies involves way too many suppliers and is unprofitable which is why ad networks had a good run at growing margins and scale for many years.</p>
<p>The technologies involved vary but basically come down to to having the ability to provide a single system that connects to multiple ad exchanges, campaign management tools for bidding optimization, integrate reporting, and advanced analysis for targeting.</p>
<p>I have written before about how there are way too many suppliers in the advertising supply<br />
chain in this <a href="http://www.startupwhisperer.com/2010/05/great-presentation-on-advertising-value-chain.html" target="_blank">post</a> and this <a href="http://www.startupwhisperer.com/2009/03/blinding-me-with-science-ad-optimizers.html" target="_blank">post</a>.</p>
<p>This recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/24/oogle-publicis-display-dsp/" target="_blank">post</a> in TechCrunch around Google&#8217;s increasingly large influence in this space really interested me.  With some reports of DSPs making up over 50% of the overall $8 billion in US display advertising, Google could end up consolidating many of the players in the supply chain.</p>

			<a href="http://www.npost.com/blog/2010/11/29/marketing-platform-independence/" title="Marketing Platform Independence"></a><p><strong>See original post at <a href="\\\\\\\">A Smart Bear: Startups and Marketing for Geeks</a>:</strong></p>
<p>Some startups die because their business model is platform-dependant. Like this:</p>
<p>Used to be, Twitter let you post anything, even advertisements, even if you didn&#8217;t identify those tweets as ads. Companies like <a title="Company home page" href="http://tweetup.com" target="_blank">TweetUp</a> and <a title="Company home page" href="http://ad.ly" target="_blank">Ad.ly</a> popped up as liaisons between advertisers and popular Twitter-ers. Specifically, an advertiser might be willing to pay $3 to have someone with 10,000 followers tweet about how great their widget is, as in this Ad.ly example:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/ad.ly-example.png" border="0" alt="ad.ly-example.png" width="444" height="74" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s like AdSense for Twitter, if you like <a title="I generally don't; here's why" href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/high-concept-pitches-are-not-your-friend.html" target="_blank">those kinds of analogies</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="display: block; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/0609.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="388" height="263" /></p>
<p>But in May, Twitter announced their own advertising platform and, in the same breath, disallowed &#8220;<em>any third party</em> to inject paid tweets into a timeline <em>on any service</em> that leverages the Twitter API&#8221; [<a title="(source)" href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/24/did-twitter-just-kill-tweetup-minutes-after-its-launch/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>]. Twitter&#8217;s <a title="Twitter's own TOS page" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> now explicitly prohibits it.</p>
<p><strong>So what happened to TweetUp and Ad.ly?</strong></p>
<p>If you visit TweetUp&#8217;s website you&#8217;ll find their name is now PostUp, and it&#8217;s no longer AdSense for Twitter. Now what they do is&#8230; ummm&#8230; a pile of <a title="My rant + solution to this epidemic" href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/authentic-dead.html" target="_blank">content-free marketing buzzwords</a>. Their slogan is &#8220;World&#8217;s Best Tweeters&#8230; and more,&#8221; which the long-time readers already know <a title="Another rant against &quot;and more,&quot; and what to do instead" href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/bed-bath-linens-things-beyond-and-more.html" target="_blank">I think is dumb</a>, and their &#8220;<a title="PostUp's &quot;About Us&quot; page" href="http://postup.com/about/" target="_blank">About Us</a>&#8221; copy is similarly useless:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’ve embarked on an exciting quest to let even more people realize the tremendous potential of social networks as a real-time information platforms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh happy day! Just want I&#8217;ve been waiting for! Wait, what <em>is</em> it exactly?</p>
<p>Oh well, maybe they don&#8217;t know either.</p>
<p><em>(P.S. Did you spot their grammatical error? Zen koan for you: If a sentence has an article-count mismatch and no one cares to read it, is it still grammatically incorrect?)</em></p>
<p>Ad.ly is still around at least, but wisely pivoted into matching celebrities (like Mandy Moore) with major brands (like NBC). They &#8220;survived.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of these companies have millions in funding, so they can afford to try new things or just flounder around. <strong>Bootstrapped companies have no such luxury.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Of course you can&#8217;t conclude that using another platform is automatically imprudent.</strong> All technology depends on &#8220;platforms&#8221; — operating systems, browsers, libraries, even pre-existing customer prejudices. But you can say that some platforms are still undergoing tumultuous change and are harder to depend on, particularly if your <em>entire</em> company depends on it.</p>
<p>The Apple App Store is perhaps the best example of a tempestuous platform, famous for screwing innovators without notice. Scandals fly almost weekly about some iPhone app inexplicably prohibited (or allowed). One telephony app is banned, the next is sanctioned. One day you&#8217;re an awesome analytics platform like <a title="Company home page" href="http://flurry.com" target="_blank">Flurry</a>, the next day Steve Jobs <a title="Gigaom piece on what transpired" href="http://gigaom.com/2010/06/02/apple-to-flurry-kiss-our-data-good-bye/" target="_blank">calls you out by name</a> because you&#8217;re &#8220;pissing us off.&#8221;</p>
<p>If an iPhone app is a fun, useful addition to your offering but it wouldn&#8217;t kill you if it vanished tomorrow, that&#8217;s great. If your entire company is based on an iPhone app, this is critical.</p>
<p>In my opinion <strong>SEO is the same way.</strong> It&#8217;s an ever-shifting landscape of shit you chase without ever really knowing what the rules are. If you&#8217;re doing SEO as one of ten tactics to get people to show up to your site, that&#8217;s great. If you&#8217;re betting the entire business on getting traffic through search results, at any moment a competitor or the platform itself could oust you.</p>
<p>Some things look like scary platform lock-in but aren&#8217;t really. Take <a title="Company home page" href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, a fully-managed Ruby on Rails platform. You &#8220;git push&#8221; your code and it&#8217;s automatically deployed across multiple redundant servers, as scalable as your wallet. Great, but they have all this black-box magic infrastructure that you&#8217;re now depending on, so isn&#8217;t that dangerous?</p>
<p>No, because it still just Rails and Postgresql — all the tools are freely available and you&#8217;ll have them installed on your laptop anyway. So if you had to leave Heroku, you&#8217;d just get a hosted server somewhere, &#8220;git clone&#8221; your code, install a database, and restore from a backup. Of course it would be a pain in the butt and could even mean a day of down-time and lost data, but that&#8217;s true no matter where you host. Your company is still alive. That means <strong>you&#8217;re exploiting Heroku as a tool; your business&#8217;s success does not depend on them.</strong></p>
<p>My company <a title="Company home page" href="http://bit.ly/WPEngine" target="_blank">WPEngine</a> depends on WordPress, which is also a platform. (In fact, many people call us &#8220;The Heroku of WordPress,&#8221; an analogy I love but most WordPress folks don&#8217;t know what Heroku is, so unfortunately it&#8217;s not a good home page marketing message.)</p>
<p><strong>But WordPress is different again because it&#8217;s an ecosystem</strong>, meaning not just a single technology controlled by a single company but a guild of many thousands of consultants, products, companies, and power users, all of whom depend on each other for revenue, attention, and credibility. Unlike Twitter, where social media marketing consultants don&#8217;t care which Twitter clients are most popular. Unlike Apple, where they rule with an iron fist no matter the consequences.</p>
<p>WordPress itself is open source; <a title="Company home page" href="http://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a> (the company behind WordPress) couldn&#8217;t kill off this community if they tried. But also we have five years of evidence that, quite the contrary, they love, support, and encourage this community, up to and including helping companies like WPEngine, like when we cut a deal with them that landed both of us <a title="Announcing VaultPress Golden Tickets available through WPEngine" href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/07/want-a-coveted-vaultpress-account-try-hosted-wordpress-platform-wp-engine/" target="_blank">on TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>So even if you want to argue there&#8217;s no difference between a &#8220;platform&#8221; and this tangled knot of forces I&#8217;m calling a &#8220;ecosystem,&#8221; I&#8217;d still argue this one is stable and supportive with clear direction.</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/remora-fish.jpg" border="0" alt="remora fish" width="200" height="180" /></p>
<p>Salesforce is one of the greatest, smartest curators of their ecosystem. They intentionally don&#8217;t add really obvious features to the base product, exactly because it would harm companies who make money adding those very features. Salesforce knows they&#8217;re the shark, and ensuring the survival of the <a title="Wikipedia; they feed off the sharks and the sharks don't mind" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remora" target="_blank">ramora fish</a> is vital for their own health and continuation.</p>
<p>So one way to avoid the platform-dependance problem is to not base your company around something that you already know is dynamic and out of your control. <strong>The other way is to diversify.</strong> Like with SEO for lead-gen, you still do it, but it&#8217;s not your only means of lead-gen. If it disappears you still have <a title="...and they'd better be good ideas" href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/startup-marketing-ideas.html" target="_blank">nine other ways to get people to your website</a>. If you&#8217;ve tried nine things and none of them are working&#8230; I guess the problem is with you, not the ten platforms!</p>
<p>In the end you have to depend on <em>something</em>, and it&#8217;s always possible the rug could be pulled our from beneath you. At least don&#8217;t pick a rug that&#8217;s already moved around the house three times.</p>
<p><em>How do you avoid marketing platform dependence? Or do you think this argument is overblown? Let&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/marketing-platform-independence.html#respond">continue in the comments</a>.</em></p>

			<a href="http://www.npost.com/blog/2010/11/24/how-much-are-startup-options-worth/" title="How much are startup options worth?"></a><p><strong>See original post at <a href="\\\\\\\">Dan Shapiro</a>:</strong></p>
<p>Startup pay kind of sucks.</p>
<p>This is not a well-kept secret.  A great startup with a dozen or so people will typically pay its employees about a third less than a big company.  Some will argue that that’s because of the value of the equity that startups give you.  I argue that that’s the price of doing something that’s more fun but of unproven economic value.</p>
<p>But regardless of why you’re doing it, there’s no question that startups ply you with ownership in the company, typically in the form of stock options.  They will argue that there’s tremendous value in those shares, more than you’ll get from a big company, but they tend to get all nervous-looking when you ask them how *much* value.  Now there’s no doubt that 1000 options on stock in a startup with 1mm shares outstanding (0.1%) has a lot more upside than 1000 options on stock in google (0.000003%).  This of course raises the simple question: what are they worth?</p>
<p>I’m going to give you a few tools you can use to take a swag at that value.  More importantly, I’m going to give you a checklist of key questions to pummel your potential new employers with that will simultaneously put you in a position of much greater knowledge, and making them think you’re a badass negotiator.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7zvffHu_wo"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 20px; border: 1px solid black;" src="http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q257/candlexlight/bride.jpg" alt="&quot;I am not left handed&quot;" width="320" height="222" /></a>Note that many people would prefer you not know this stuff.  At most startups, the equity’s worth a lot less than you might imagine (as you’ll see below).  One of my favorite bloggers, Mark Suster, argues that you should just <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/09/06/how-to-discuss-stock-options-with-your-team/">assume the equity is valueless and be pleasantly surprised if you find otherwise</a>.  This is one of the reasons I admire Mark – he’s so good at closing candidates that before he does it, he takes on voluntary challenges.  It’s like he’s working on an xbox achievement.</p>
<p>Me? I want my potential new hires to know exactly what they’re getting, erring neither high nor low.  I don’t want them misled with a number that’s too big, or there’s hell to pay when they realize they’ve been had.  And I don’t want to sandbag, because closing a hire is hard enough without telling people to ignore the equity upside.  So that’s what I’m here to tell you: how to know if you’re getting a good deal from a startup.  And my secret ulterior motive is this: I usually give my employees a great deal on their equity.  That means that if they’re informed consumers, my companies’ offers look awesome compared to anything else they’re seeing.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics, which are completely misleading.  Then I’ll get to the important stuff.</p>
<p>The value of a whack of equity is this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ValueOfCompany%20*%20\frac{SharesYouGet}{FullyDilutedShares}" alt="value of company * (shares you get / fully diluted shares)" width="333" height="42" /></p>
<p>Quite simply, it’s your percent ownership times the company’s value.  Seems simple enough, but it’s totally wrong.  There’s a little reason why and a big reason.  The little reason is that the above equation describes the value of <em>shares</em>.  You’re probably receiving <em>options</em>.  An option is worth less than a share.  How much less is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes">excruciatingly difficult to model accurately</a>.  It’s about the same before your first financing round, but it can be a meaningful difference if your company has taken on a few subsequent rounds of capital.</p>
<p>The big reason is something investors don’t like to talk about, but here it is: <strong>the existence of preferred, “investor” shares significantly devalues regular, common shares</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn’t some sort of rant: it’s basic economics.  You see, investors typically take rights when they invest that put them “in front” of regular investors.  If they invest a million bucks and the company sells for a million bucks, they get their money back and everyone else gets nothing.  It’s called a preference, and <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2005/01/term-sheet-liquidation-preference.html">Brad has explained it much better than I can</a>.  It has a colossal impact on the expected returns.  They also often have something called participation, meaning that after they get their money back, they continue to get returns as if they hadn’t.  And then they have a set of terms called “protective provisions” which (<a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2005/01/term-sheet-protective-provisions.html">more Bradness</a>) explicitly allow them to block actions that are in the best interest of the company’s shareholders, as a whole, and supported by a majority of shareholders.</p>
<p>Back <a href="http://www.xtranormal.com/watch/7471325/">when the IRS allowed such things</a>, the rule of thumb was that common stock was worth <em>one tenth</em> as much as preferred stock.  And the “value of company” number, above, is a preferred stock number.  Yikes.</p>
<p>So that’s the bad news: options on common shares in a venture funded company have a pretty crappy book value.</p>
<p>If you thought the company was worth what the IRS does, you probably would just take Mark’s advice and ignore the equity.  But there’s other ways to look at it.</p>
<p>Another, quite reasonable way to consider the value of the options (or at least their value to you), is to look at what you predict they’ll be worth.  Most startups that try to sell the value of your options do this in an optimistic (some might say “false”) way.  I’ve heard the phrase “Our company just wouldn’t accept an offer of less than $500,000,000″ uttered by recruiters.  But there’s a right way as well as a wrong way.</p>
<p>The basic math for this one is:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?SalePrice*PercentOwnership" alt="SalePrice * PercentOwnership" width="249" height="17" /></p>
<p>that means you take your shares, divide by total shares, and multiply by what you think it’ll sell for.  Of course, nothing’s that simple.  You have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account for the possibility that the company may fail</li>
<li>Consider dilution from subsequent financing rounds</li>
<li>Subtract any preference</li>
<li>Account for any participation</li>
<li>Subtract bonus/retention/carveout packages</li>
</ul>
<p>and a bunch of other tricks that investors (and management) can use to manipulate the return curve.  This becomes unbelievably complicated, since key factors are things like how good a negotiator your CEO is.  To try and capture all of this, I banged out a set of heuristics (definition: “statements people will argue about”) that you can use to make a crude estimate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you believe in the company?  Really, really believe it’s going to be awesome?  Feel in your guts that it’s going to be something amazing?  90% of new companies fail, so if you don’t, then you should assume your stock is worthless, and stop here.  Also, you should go work elsewhere, because life’s too short.</li>
<li>Ask the company: “What is your expected exit range, and what comparables did you use to get there?”  (in English: how much will you sell for, and who do you use as a basis for comparison).  If you agree that this company looks like the comparables, then take the low number and divide it by 2. If they say it’s going to IPO, divide by 10 instead. This is X.</li>
<li>Ask how many rounds have been raised, and how much more they expect to raise before they exit.  Add them together, then double them, to get Y.</li>
<li>Ask if there’s a preference, and if so, what multiple.  Ask if there’s participation, and if so, is it capped.</li>
<li>Cube the preference (as in, 2 x 2 x 2).  That’s Z.</li>
<li>If there’s a capped participation, add 1 to Z.  If it’s uncapped, add 2.</li>
<li>Ask who’s on the board.  If a majority of board members are employees/founders, do nothing.  If it’s a 50/50 balance between founders and investors, add 1 to Z.  If it’s tilted towards the investors, add 2 to Z.</li>
<li>Now for the grand finale:</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X-(Y*Z)" alt="X-(Y*Z)" width="96" height="19" /></p>
<p>And that’s what they’re worth.  Here’s an example:</p>
<p>You’re being offered 0.1% of a great company that thinks they’ll exit for $250-500mm.  They’ve raised $5mm and expect to raise $10mm more.  Terms are 1x preference, capped participation. The board is evenly split between founders and investors.</p>
<p>X: 250/2=<strong>125<br />
</strong>Y: 15*2=<strong>30</strong><br />
Z: 1^3+1+1=<strong>3</strong></p>
<p>125-(30*3) = $35mm.</p>
<p>You should consider your shares to be worth 0.1% * $35mm = $35k.</p>
<p>I love startups.  I love it when people get rich from startups.  I want you to join a startup, and I want it to shower you with riches beyond your wildest dreams.  I want you to blow all this math out of the water.  It’s all guesstimates anyway… but it’s better than fencing left handed.</p>

			<a href="http://www.npost.com/blog/2010/11/17/the-interoperability-of-social-networks/" title="The interoperability of social networks"></a><p><strong>See original post at <a href="\\\\\\\">cdixon.org &#8211; chris dixon&#8217;s blog</a>:</strong></p>
<p>Google recently added a caustic warning <a href="http://www.google.com/mail/help/contacts_export_confirm.html">message</a> when users attempt to export their Google Contacts to Facebook:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hold on a second. Are you super sure you want to import your contact information for your friends into a service that won’t let you get it out?</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook allows users to download their personal information (photos, profile info, etc) but has been fiercely protective of the social graph (you can’t download friends, etc). The downloaded data arrives in a .zip file – hardly a serious attempt to interoperate using modern APIs (<em>update: Facebook employee corrects me/clarifies in comments </em><a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/11/10/the-interoperability-of-social-networks/#comment-96196129"><em>here</em></a>). In contrast, Google has taken an aggressively open posture with respect to the social graph, calling Facebook’s policy “data protectionism.”</p>
<p>The economic logic behind these positions is a straightforward application of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law">Metcalf’s law</a>, which states that the value of a network is the square of the number of nodes in the network*.  A corollary to Metcalf’s law is that when two networks connect or interoperate the smaller network benefits more than the larger network does. If network A has 10 users then according to Metcalf’s law its “value” is 100 (10*10).   If network B has 20 users than it’s value is 400 (20*20). If they interoperate, network A gains 400 in value but network B only gains 100 in value. Interoperating is generally good for end users, but assuming the two networks are directly competitive – one’s gain is the other’s loss – the larger network loses.</p>
<p>A similar network interoperability battle happened last decade among Instant Messaging networks. AIM was the dominant network for many years and refused to interoperate with other networks. Google Chat adopted open standards (Jabber) and MSN and Yahoo were much more open to interoperating. Eventually this battle ended in a whimper — AIM never generated much revenue, and capitulated to aggregators and openness.  (Capitulating was probably a big mistake – they had the opportunity to be as financially successful as Skype or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent_QQ">Tencent</a>).</p>
<p>Google might very well genuinely believe in openness. But it is also <a href="http://cdixon.org/2009/12/30/whats-strategic-for-google/">strategically wise</a> for them to be open in layers that are not strategic (mobile OS, social graph, Google docs) while remaining closed in layers that are strategic (search ranking algorithm, virtually all of their advertising services).</p>
<p>When Google releases their long-awaited new social network, Google Me, expect an emphasis on openness. This could create a rich ecosystem around their social platform that could put pressure on Facebook to interoperate. True interoperability would be great for startups, innovation, and – most importantly – end users.</p>
<p><span>* Metcalf’s law assumes that every node is connected to every node and each connection is equally valuable. Real world networks are normally not like this. In particular, social networks are much more clustered and therefore have somewhere between linear and exponential utility growth with each additional user.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The essence of profound insight is simplicity.&#8221;</em><br />
<em> &#8211;Jim Collins (Good To Great)</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This is the story of my father, Burt Walker, a poor kid from Brooklyn who made millions taking the company he founded public — and then lost it all when he left my mother for a younger woman.  I am sharing this personal story to help entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><strong>Setting the stage</strong></p>
<p>My father was raised in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Brooklyn#History" target="_blank">Brownsville</a>, a poor section of Brooklyn, New York.  He had an absentee father, a crazy mother and a wild younger brother.  He worked from the time he was 9 or 10 years old, including selling ice-cream sandwiches at the Coney Island beach.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ronsaari.com/stockImages/nyc/ConeyIsland.php"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-411" title="Coney Island" src="http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/ConeyIsland-e1287595244338.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>My father&#8217;s father, Arnold Walker, was the son of immigrants who arrived in this country with nothing but the shirts on their backs.  Grandpa Arnold was a tough, <a href="http://www.goldengloves.com/welcome/" target="_blank">Golden Gloves</a> boxer, who worked at the local railroad and then opened a hardware store with his brother.</p>
<p>My father&#8217;s mother, Goldie Buch, was a High School beauty and then lost her mind somewhat due to medication administered to her during my father&#8217;s birth.  Grandma Goldie stayed at home and raised the two boys, but had few tools to cope.  For example, she rarely cleaned the apartment and kept three types of milk in the refrigerator: fresh for my father&#8217;s brother; a few days&#8217; old for my father; and sour for my father&#8217;s father (who was rarely around in any event).</p>
<p>My father was a good High School student and was accepted for admission at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytechnic_Institute_of_New_York_University" target="_blank">Brooklyn Polytechnic University</a>, where he studied electrical engineering and paid his way by going <a href="http://www.goarmy.com/rotc.html" target="_blank">ROTC</a> (i.e., by joining the army).  Upon graduation, he married my mother and was stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina for two years, where I was born.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-412" title="fort bragg" src="http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/fort-bragg.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="264" /></p>
<p>Our family then moved back to Brooklyn (where my brother was born) and then to Long Island into a small house my parents purchased with a loan from my mother&#8217;s father.  It is here where my father began his 15-year journey from entry-level engineer at Western Union to founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4301881.html">Walker Telecommunications Corporation</a>, a NASDAQ-listed public company.</p>
<h3><strong>Lesson #1: Work Hard and Be Patient</strong></h3>
<p>My father was intensely driven to prove himself.  Deep down, he always felt like &#8220;the poor kid with the crazy mother&#8221; (as my mother&#8217;s mother referred to him when she initially forbade my mother from marrying him).  But his insecurity and drive created in him a powerful work ethic and singular focus to succeed.  Indeed, this is why many CEO&#8217;s and other business leaders prefer hiring hungry, working-class guys over the wealthy Ivy-leaguers.</p>
<p><em>[Editor's note: For me too, "insecurity" and the desire to "prove something" to no one in particular is a primary driver. It also results in <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/self-doubt-fraud.html">Impostor's Syndrome</a> and other undesirable side-effects, but if you're conscious of it you can keep down-sides under control.]</em></p>
<p>In addition to his strong work ethic, my father had an extraordinary ability to be patient.</p>
<p>My father spent the first 12+ years of his career working his tail off at several different companies.  He even went back to school at night for four years and obtained an MBA-equivalent in electrical engineering.  I remember as a little kid watching him come home from his &#8220;day job,&#8221; have a quick dinner, and then get back into his car to go to &#8220;night school.&#8221;  In fact, looking back, it seemed like he had a master plan that he knew from the start was going take many years to execute.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many entrepreneurs today are looking for the quick home-run — the lottery ticket.  Other than in very rare circumstances, however, it just doesn&#8217;t work that way.  You have to grind it out for years to succeed: seven years, ten years — maybe even longer.  Day in and day out — pushing that big rock up the hill, one step at a time.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (the creator of <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and a partner at <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>) notes in <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2359">a recent speech to Stanford students</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nobody is an overnight success.  Most overnight successes you see have been working at it for ten years.  And that&#8217;s exactly how it was for us.&#8221; [<a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2359">starting at the 0:12 mark</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Vaynerchuk">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> (the founder of <a href="http://tv.winelibrary.com/">Wine Library TV</a> and the so-called &#8220;<a href="http://vaynermedia.com/our-story/">Social Media Sommelier</a>&#8220;) made a similar point in a speech at the <a href="http://walkercorporatelaw.com/motivational-speeches/motivational-clips-for-entrepreneurs-%E2%80%9Chustle-is-the-most-important-word-ever%E2%80%9D-via-gary-vaynerchuk/">Web 2.0 Expo in New York</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban">Mark Cuban</a> (billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the <a href="http://www.nba.com/mavericks/">Dallas Mavericks</a>) has a similar story, as he discusses <a href="http://walkercorporatelaw.com/motivational-speeches/motivational-clips-for-entrepreneurs-selling-by-day-learning-by-night-via-mark-cuban/">in this video</a>:</p>

<p>Work hard and be patient.</p>
<h3><strong>Lesson #2: Build Strong Relationships with Key People in Your Industry</strong></h3>
<p>When I was about 14 years old, my father quit <a href="http://www.comtechtel.com/">Comtech Telecommunications Corp.</a> (&#8220;Comtech&#8221;), a small public company in Long Island where he was the Director of Marketing, and launched his own consulting firm.  This was the beginning of something big — very big.  While at Comtech, my father had developed strong relationships with a few key senior executives at <a href="http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/NISSHO-IWAI-KK-Company-History.html">Nissho Iwai Corporation</a>, a huge<a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n20_v110/ai_7995945/"> Japanese trading company</a>.  They now wanted to retain his services to help them sell satellite earth stations and other telecommunications equipment to US-based companies.</p>
<p>This relationship with Nissho Iwai would become the foundation of Walker Telecommunications Corporation — and it took years for my father to nuture and grow.  I remember him reading book after book about the Japanese culture and customs, and I remember his many trips to Japan — when my mother, brother and I wouldn&#8217;t see him for weeks at a time.  Indeed, I still have a few of his postcards in my childhood scrapbook.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3011.html"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-413" title="japan" src="http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/japan-photo-500x273.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="273" /></a></p>
<p>And this is lesson #2 for entrepreneurs: build strong relationships with key people in your industry.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs don&#8217;t understand the importance of building strong relationships — or even understand what a strong relationship is.  Building a strong relationship requires time and effort and usually requires providing the other party with some kind of value.  Yes, give and you shall receive.</p>
<p>Strong relationships aren&#8217;t built overnight.  Nor are they built by merely following someone on Twitter or friending someone on Facebook.  Perhaps that&#8217;s a start, but that&#8217;s all it is.  <strong>The same way passing-out business cards at an event is just a start.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, building a strong relationship takes time because the other party must learn to trust and respect you.  That&#8217;s why college or business school is often a good place to build relationships.  You are spending years with your fellow classmates; you are developing friendships and trust; and you are working on projects/schoolwork together.</p>
<p>A job is also a great place to build strong relationships — with your boss, your co-workers and/or your customers.  How?  By working hard, by producing, by acting with integrity and by being likeable.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/author/tina_seelig">Tina Seelig</a>, Executive Director for the <a href="http://stvp.stanford.edu/">Stanford Technology Ventures Program</a>, explains in <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=1471">this video clip</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is a very small world&#8230; You are going to bump into the same people again and again and again&#8230; You need to make sure that the relationships you build now and as you move forward are ones that you&#8217;re proud of &#8230; and are not going to come back and bite you in the behind.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.udemy.com/u/gaganbiyani/">Gagan Biyani</a>, the Co-Founder and President of <a href="http://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, discusses in this <a href="http://mixergy.com/udemy-gagan-biyani-interview/">video interview</a> with <a href="http://mixergy.com/about/">Andrew Warner</a> of <a href="http://mixergy.com/">Mixergy.com</a> how his initial fundraising failed because he did not have any strong relationships:</p>
<blockquote><p>[N]one of these people knew us. &#8230; We&#8217;d show up at the pitch meeting, and we were some random guy who came in through an introduction.  It was really hard to convince them that we were worth their time.</p>
<p>So what I did for the next six months after that, after we had failed and closed down the fundraising process, . . . I spent the entire time meeting as many people as possible.  So I&#8217;d go to tons of Silicon Valley events.  At night when I was dead tired from working all day, I would get myself up and get in the car and drive over to San Francisco or drive over to Palo Alto and attend an event and give out my business card and get business cards.  And that was super important because I got to know a lot of these investors.  Like Dave McClure definitely saw me 15 times before he invested in my company.  He met me at conferences, he met me at dinners.  I attended his events.  I was friends with all of his friends. . . . So when I go to raise money, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I kind of know this guy.&#8221; [starting at the 35:39 mark]</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Lesson #3: Don&#8217;t Mix Business with Pleasure</strong></h3>
<p>My father was very successful in his consulting position and was instrumental in a number of significant sales of earth stations and satellite equipment.  Accordingly, Nissho Iwai developed so much confidence in my father that they offered him the exclusive right to sell in the United States high-tech business telephones manufactured by a top Japanese company.  As a result, Walker Telecommunications Corporation was born.  This licensing agreement was indeed so valuable that my father was able to sell the story to Wall Street and go public, raising millions of dollars to scale his new company.</p>
<p>From there, the company&#8217;s growth was extraordinary — with expansion into other markets, including car phones, cell phones, fiber optic networks and other telecommunications equipment, and offices in New York, San Francisco and Toronto.  In fact, by the time I was a freshman in college, <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20101001/index.html">Inc. magazine</a> named Walker Telecommunications Corporation one of the nation&#8217;s fastest-growing companies.</p>
<p>But then it all came crashing down about five years later.  Why?  Probably a few different reasons, but the one that stands-out above all others is my father&#8217;s relationship with the wife of a company employee, the head of sales on the West coast, whom he eventually married (and then divorced).  She was also a headhunter, and my father started utilizing her firm to hire key executives at the company.  Needless to say, this was the beginning of the end — and the third and final lesson for entrepreneurs: Do not mix business with pleasure.</p>
<p>Now, no matter how many times entrepreneurs hear this basic advice, there will always be a handful who will ignore it.  &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal?&#8221;  &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to find out?&#8221;  &#8220;Why should anyone care?&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-414" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1ex 1.5em;" title="jodie fisher" src="http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/jodie-fisher.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="256" />Folks: It doesn&#8217;t work!  Do not mix business with pleasure!  You have to separate your company (and running a business) with your personal life.  Just ask <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hurd">Mark Hurd</a>, the former CEO of <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/index.html">Hewlett-Packard</a>, who was terminated as a result of his relationship with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jodie-fisher-mark-hurd">Jodie Fisher</a> [shown at right], an actress and reality-show contestant hired as a contractor for HP.</p>
<p>As the Wall Street Journal aptly points out in their post, &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2010/08/09/h-ps-mark-hurd-and-jodie-fisher-when-workplace-flirtations-go-bad/">When Workplace Flirtations Go Bad</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he [Hurd] fracas serves as a reminder that office relationships can be fraught with landmines.  Even strong flirtations among co-workers that don&#8217;t culminate into full-blown affairs can have real and serious consequences — and can change the mood and equilibrium of the office.  For one, it can be tough for other co-workers to concentrate when two colleagues are engaging in flirty banter or making googly eyes at each other.  And if feelings change or aren&#8217;t fully reciprocated within the couple, then office tensions can run high.</p></blockquote>
<p>David Letterman also learned the hard way about office affairs and discussed this issue and the related alleged extortion on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuAmg6mD9js">The Late Show</a> about a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The foregoing lessons are simple: (i) work hard and be patient; (ii) build relationships with key people; and (iii) don&#8217;t mix business with pleasure.  Like anything else, however, it&#8217;s the execution which is so difficult.  Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Do these lessons resonate with you?</strong> Will you do anything differently as a result? Have your own stories? Let&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/three-entrepreneur-lessons.html#respond">continue the discussion in the comments</a>.</p>
