doesn't want to be free. Information wants to be valuable.&quot; I first heard 
this gem from Larry Wall, creator of the Perl programming language. Like many 
other open-source software authors, from Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, to 
Tim Berners-Lee and his spiritual descendants at the Apache web server project, 
Larry discovered that one way to make his information (i.e., his software) more 
valuable was to make it free. Larry was thus able to increase its utility not 
only for himself (because others who took it up made changes and enhancements 
that he could use), but for everyone else who uses it, because as software becomes 
more ubiquitous it can be taken for granted as a foundation for further work. 
The Internet (based on freely available software including TCP/IP, BIND, Apache, 
Sendmail and so on) demonstrates clearly just how much value can be created by 
the distribution of freely available software.<br> <br> Nonetheless, it is also 
clear that others, Bill Gates being the paramount example, have found that the 
best way to make their information valuable is to restrict access to it. No-one 
can question that Microsoft has created enormous value for itself and its shareholders, 
and even its critics should admit that Microsoft has been a key enabler of the 
ubiquitous personal computing on which so much of our modern business world depends.<br> 
<br> What many people fail to realize is that both Larry Wall and Bill Gates have 
a great deal in common: as the creators (albeit with a host of co-contributors) 
of a body of intellectual work, they have made strategic decisions about how best 
to maximize its value. History has proven that each of their strategies can work. 
The question, then, is one of goals, and of the strategies to reach those goals. 
The question for publishers and other middlemen who are not themselves the creators 
of the content they distribute, is how best to serve those goals. Information 
wants to be valuable. Publishers must focus on increasing the value, both to its 
producers and to its consumers, of the information they aggregate and distribute.<br> 
</p><p>I am neither a practising scientist nor a publisher of scientific journals, 
but as a book and web publisher who works on a regular basis to document widely 
available 'infrastructure' software (both free and commercial), I am daily confronted 
with decisions akin to those reflected in the debate now being carried in these 
pages. Because I publish books about free software, the people best qualified 
to write about it are often the authors of the software. Like scientists, those 
authors often have as their ideal the widest possible dissemination of their software 
and information about how to use it, rather than the greatest economic gain. They 
would like to see the documentation they write distributed freely along with the 
software.<br> </p><p>At other times, though, software authors see documentation 
as an afterthought. They would rather not deal with it, and hope that someone 
else will. In those cases, the question of compensation often comes into play. 
Will a third party who is motivated chiefly by money earn enough from this book 
to justify the time writing it?<br> </p><p>In helping authors to navigate this 
discussion, I try to bring them back to their goal. Is it maximum dissemination 
of information or is it earning enough to justify the work? I should note that 
the jury is still out on whether making the text of a book freely available helps 
or hurts sales of a print book. There is evidence on both sides. </p><p>In some 
cases, such as Eric Raymond's book, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, free distribution 
of the content created the 'buzz' that allowed us to publish the same material 
successfully in print. In other cases, such as our initial publication of the 
Linux Network Administrator's Guide, sales were reduced because other companies 
republished some or all of the book at lower cost, which they could do because 
they had no development costs or royalties. However, over time this problem abated, 
because the fact that those publishers were not adding value was recognized by 
the target audience, and eventually marginalized their products.<br> </p><p>I 
see many parallels between the work of free software authors and the work of scientists. 
In most cases, both are more interested in making sure their work is disseminated 
than in maximizing their return from it. In most cases, the target reader is a 
peer of the author. Publishing is designed to enhance reputation as well as to 
spread the word. Publishers must be careful to keep prices fair, lest they be 
seen as taking advantage of the goodwill of their authors, gouging the very customers 
who also produce their content.<br> <br> In this kind of environment, you have 
to ask about the role of the publisher as middleman. No one who started as a self-published 
author and gradually developed all the infrastructure of publishing (as I did) 
can question the enormous added value that a publisher brings to the table. This 
value includes editing (which starts with content filtering - the choice of what 
to publish and what to refuse - and extends through content development and quality 
control), manufacturing of the physical product, marketing, sales, distribution 
and collecting and disbursing money.<br> <br> In the early days of the World Wide 
Web, the rhetoric was that anyone could be a publisher. After all, with cheap, 
ubiquitous web servers, the cost of printing and inventory was minimized. There 
was a great deal of talk of 'disintermediation'.<br> <br> In a few short years, 
the reality has turned out quite otherwise. It is quite easy to put up a web page, 
not so easy to discover it. The fundamental job of publishing is precisely mediation: 
mediation between a huge class of potential authors, and an even larger class 
of potential readers. Simple mathematics dictates the rise of multi-tiered distribution 
chains, in which publishers aggregate authors, various types of resellers aggregate 
readers, and wholesalers aggregate publishers for resellers and resellers for 
publishers. The same multi-tiered distribution has emerged on the web. Betting 
on this logic, my company created the first web portal, a site called GNN (<a href="http://members.aol.com/andycamps/gnn/home.htm" TARGET="_blank">Global 
Network Navigator</a>) in early 1993. We sold the site to <a href="http://www.aol.com" TARGET="_blank">AOL</a> 
in 1995, and they later folded it into their main service, but the vision of web 
aggregators (i.e., publishers) has unfolded pretty much as I imagined it.<br> 
</p><p>Many people with their own web pages end up writing for better-established 
websites; those sites are further aggregated for readers by search engines, directories 
and other portals such as <a href="http://www.google.com" TARGET="_blank">Google</a>, 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com" TARGET="_blank">Yahoo!</a> or AOL. In fact, web 
publishers now employ full-time workers to ensure that their pages are listed 
on these gateway sites, much as publishers of printed books employ sales people. 
A large proportion of Internet advertising has come from websites trying to get 
better visibility for their product.<br> </p><p>However, the web does bring another 
wrinkle: the ability of groups to self-aggregate. The core functions of publishing, 
from content filtering to audience aggregation, can be performed by a group of 
interested users. This is particularly true when there is already a well-defined 
target community. This can be a disruptive force in the publishing marketplace. 
So, for example, sites such as <a href="http://www.cnet.com" TARGET="_blank">Cnet</a> 
and <a href="http://www.zdnet.com" TARGET="_blank">ZDnet</a> spent tens of millions 
of dollars building and promoting portals for technical information on the web, 
while two college students built a site called <a href="http://www.slashdot.org" TARGET="_blank">Slashdot</a> 
(&quot;News for Nerds. Stuff that matters.&quot;) into a similarly powerful market 
presence simply by inviting their readers to submit, organize and comment on their 
own content. </p><p>Interestingly enough, though, as Slashdot has grown in popularity 
and evolved into a real business, it has needed to add more editorial staff to 
filter the submissions of a growing marketplace of readers who now recognize that 
exposure via Slashdot is a powerful marketing tool. In short, even a community-centric 
effort ends up recreating some of the fundamental dynamics of publisher as middleman 
and aggregator.<br> </p><p>What this evolution illustrates is that publishers 
will not go away, but that they cannot be complacent. Publishers must serve the 
values of both authors and readers. If they try to enforce an artificial scarcity, 
charge prices that are too high or otherwise violate the norms of their target 
community, they will encourage that community to self-organize, or new competitors 
will emerge who are better attuned to the values of the community.<br> </p></td></tr>
