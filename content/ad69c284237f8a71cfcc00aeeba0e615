<h3>PC204 &ndash; The <i>matplotlib</i> Plotting Package</h3>
<blockquote>
<a HREF="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib</a> is a
comprehensive Python plotting library for producing publication-quality
figures.  It has excellent documentation, example code for each type
of plot, and lots of options so that you can make your plots look just
the way you want.  Take a look at the matplotlib
<a HREF="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html">image gallery</a>
to see the wealth of different plots this package is capable of making.
<p>
Matplotlib requires <a HREF="http://numpy.scipy.org/">numpy</a>, a package
for handling large numerical arrays and performing operations such as
linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transforms.  The current
release of matplotlib, version 0.99, requires numpy version 1.1 or later,
and numpy itself requires Python version 2.5 or later.

<h4>Installation Notes:</h4>
<blockquote>
<b>OS X 10.6 - Snow Leopard:</b>
<br>
Snow Leopard comes with Python 2.6.1 and numpy 1.2.1, so these versions are just fine.
All you have to do is download this <a href="SnowLeopardmpl.pkg">matplotlib package</a>
built especially for OS X 10.6 and install it.  To install the package, save the file
and double click it, which will run the Installer.  When the "Select a Destination" panel
in the Installer appears, click on "Install for all users of this computer" and click
Continue.  You will also need to enter the administrator password for your computer.
<p>
<b>OS X 10.5 - Leopard:</b>
<br>
Leopard includes Python version 2.5.1, but it unfortunately includes an older
replease of numpy (1.0.1) that is not compatible with matplotlib.  To make
matters worse, Leopard keeps Python together with other Mac "system" files
and this makes it difficult to just download and install a newer release of
numpy.  (If you try to install numpy 1.2.1 on OS X 10.5 you'll get the rather
obscure error message "numpy requires python.org Framework Build Python
2.5 to install.")
The easiest approach is just to go the python.org web site, download and install
<a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.2/python-2.6.2-macosx2009-04-16.dmg">Python 2.6.2</a>,
then download and install
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.3.0/numpy-1.3.0-py2.6-macosx10.5.dmg/download">numpy 1.3.0</a>,
and finally download and install
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-0.99.1/matplotlib-0.99.1.1-py2.6-macosx10.5.dmg/download">matplotlib 0.99.1.1</a>.
The only disadvantage of this approach is that you'll use up a little
more disk space by having two copies of Python installed on your computer,
but most systems have plenty of space available and so this is not really
a problem.
<p>
<b>Windows:</b>
<br>
Microsoft Windows doesn't come with any version of Python pre-installed.
The easiest approach is just to go the python.org web site, download and install
<a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.2/python-2.6.2.msi">Python 2.6.2</a>,
then download and install
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.3.0/numpy-1.3.0-win32-superpack-python2.6.exe/download">numpy 1.3.0</a>,
and finally download and install
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-0.99.1/matplotlib-0.99.1.win32-py2.6.exe/download">matplotlib 0.99.1</a>.
These are all standard Windows installers; you just save them to disk and double-click on their icons.

<b>Testing</b>
<blockquote>
Regardless of what operating system you're using, try running this simple
Python script to verify that matplotlib is working properly:
<blockquote>
<pre>
from matplotlib import pyplot
from pylab import randn
x = randn(1000)
y = pyplot.hist(x, bins=100)
pyplot.show()
</pre>
</blockquote>
This creates a simple histogram of 1,000 zero-mean, unit-variance
Gaussian random numbers generated by the randn() function.
</blockquote>
<b>Trouble Shooting</b>
<blockquote>
If you run into problems installing matplotlib or one of the other packages mentioned
above, the easier thing to do is come see one of the
<a href="instructors.html">course instructors</a> for help.

<h4>Alternative Packages</h4>
<blockquote>
If for some reason matplotlib isn't the right package for you,
you might consider one of these alternatives:
<ul>
  <li><a HREF="http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/">gnuplot.py</a> &ndash;
      a Python wrapper to the popular <a HREF="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a>
      plotting package
  <li><a HREF="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/doc/Blt.html">pmw.blt</a> &ndash;
      a Python interface to the <a HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/blt/">BLT Toolkit</a>
      extension to Tcl/Tk, with basic support for producing 2D graphs,
      barcharts, and stripcharts
</ul>
