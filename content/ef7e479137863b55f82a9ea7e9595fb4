				<h2>How to Snatch an Expiring Domain</h2>
				<div class="dateline">March 6th, 2005 <!-- by Mike D. --></div>
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I recently found myself in the position of wanting to register a domain which was owned by someone else.  The domain was set to expire in a week, and I figured there was a decent chance that the person who owned it wouldn&#8217;t be renewing it.  Upon consulting the WhoIs registry on the current owner, I discovered the guy was a bit of a domain shark and didn&#8217;t seem to be around anymore.</p>
<p>So I placed a backorder through <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/Domain_Alert/landing.asp?se=%2B&#038;ci=258" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a> for $18.95 thinking that was all I needed to do.  During the week that followed, I learned a <strong>lot</strong> about the domain expiration process.  Two and a half months and $369 later, I am the proud owner of a shiny new domain.  A really really good one.</p>
<p>This article will explain the domain expiration process and what you need to do in order to use it to your advantage.<br />
<span id="more-74"></span></p>
<h3>How a domain expires</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, domains do not expire when they say they do.  If the owner of a domain does not renew by the expiration date of the domain, the domain goes into &#8220;expired&#8221; status.  For 40 days, the domain is in a grace period where all services are shut off, but the domain owner may still renew the domain for a standard renewal fee.  If a domain enters this period, it is a good first indicator that it may not be renewed, but since the owner can re-register without penalty, it can also just be a sign of laziness or procrastination.</p>
<p>After 40 days are up, the domain&#8217;s status changes to &#8220;redemption period&#8221;.  During this phase, all WhoIs information begins disappearing, and more importantly, it now costs the owner an additional fee to re-activate and re-register the domain.  The fee is currently around $100, depending on your registrar.  When a domain enters its redemption period, it&#8217;s a good bet the owner has decided not to renew.</p>
<p>Finally, after the redemption period, the domain&#8217;s status will change to &#8220;locked&#8221; as it enters the deletion phase.  The deletion phase is 5 days long, and on the last day between 11am and 2pm Pacific time, the name will officially drop from the ICANN database and will be available for registration by anybody.</p>
<p>The entire process ends exactly 75 days after the listed expiration date.  For an even more detailed explanation, read the article <a href="http://dnjournal.com/columns/cover080504.htm" target="_blank">Inside a Drop Catcher&#8217;s War Room</a>.</p>
<h3>Landing your domain</h3>
<p>So if domains are available to the general public 75 days after they expire, how do you know your GoDaddy backorder isn&#8217;t one of many other backorders from other people using other services?  The answer is, you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And thus begins the cloak-and-dagger game of &#8220;getting in on The Drop&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Drop&#8221; is the unpredictable three hour period of time in which the domain is deleted from VeriSign&#8217;s database and released back into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I briefly thought about trying to beat GoDaddy to the punch by manually registering my domain during the drop process, but I quickly found out that there are no fewer than three major services which specialize in pounding away on VeriSign&#8217;s servers during the drop period.  With their considerable resources and my measly Powerbook, there was no way I could compete on their level.</p>
<p>So I decided to enlist the services of all three major domain snatching firms in hopes that a) one would grab my domain for me, and b) no one else would be competing against me.</p>
<p>The three services &#8212; <a href="http://www.snapnames.com" target="_blank">Snapnames.com</a>, <a href="http://www.enom.com" target="_blank">Enom.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.pool.com" target="_blank">Pool.com</a> &#8212; all operate in a similar manner.  They use a network of registrars to hit the Verisign servers at frequent intervals (but not too frequent to get banned) and snatch as many requested names as possible.  If you don&#8217;t get your name, you don&#8217;t pay.  But that&#8217;s where the three services begin to differ.</p>
<h4>Snapnames.com</h4>
<p>Snapnames.com (the exclusive partner of Network Solutions) charges you $60 for your domain unless there are multiple suitors, at which point there is an open bid auction between suitors.  Seems fair enough.  Snapnames is a bit of a newcomer to the game, but with their Network Solutions affiliation, they are said to be improving their success rates.</p>
<h4>Enom.com</h4>
<p>Not wanting to chance it with only one company, I also enlisted Enom to snatch my domain for me.  Enom had reportedly been improving their <a href="http://www.clubdrop.com/" target="_blank">&#8220;Club Drop&#8221;</a> service for a year or two and it was now considered one of the top three.  Their fee was only $30 and they are based in my &#8216;hood (Seattle), so I was hoping they would be the company to successfully &#8220;work The Drop&#8221; for me.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it starts to get sketchy though.</p>
<p>Enom claims that the higher your bid is (beyond the $30), the more &#8220;resources&#8221; they will dedicate to grabbing the domain.  What the hell?  How am I supposed to judge that?  Does that mean you&#8217;re using one server now and will use 30 servers if I bid $40?  Or does it mean that you&#8217;re using 30 now and will use 35 if I bid $1000?</p>
<p>Not knowing exactly what to do, I attempted to bid a couple of hundred dollars during the last day, but Enom required me to send them a fax to become a &#8220;verified bidder&#8221;.  Since I was at home that day and only dinosaurs still have fax machines, I was unable to increase my bid.  Oh well, I thought, if someone else on Enom bids higher, at least I&#8217;ll be able to participate in the auction.</p>
<h4>Pool.com</h4>
<p>Pool.com is the <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/105783/" target="_blank">Scott Boras</a> of domain name grabbing  &#8212;  the brilliant, yet conniving agent that players (domains) love and team owners (prospective domain buyers) hate.  Pool plays off the power of the unknown in such a fiendishly clever way that you don&#8217;t know whether to hug them or kill them.  Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<p>Pool is the #1 company around as far as number of servers and success rates go.  You place your original bid for $60 and if Pool.com grabs your name for you, they send you an e-mail telling you they&#8217;ve been successful and that you&#8217;ve now entered &#8220;Phase 1&#8243; of the two-phase auction system.  This is the case whether or not you are the only bidder!  Pool.com doesn&#8217;t even reveal how many bidders there are.</p>
<p>Then, in a Boras-like move of diabolical genius, Pool.com informs you that you have three days to place a new sealed bid.  If the bid is either one of the top two bids or within 30% of the top bid, you move on to a one-day open bid auction (the &#8220;challenger&#8221; auction) for final control of the domain.</p>
<p>Grrrrreat.</p>
<p>So if I bid $100 and two people bid $140, I don&#8217;t even get to move on to the final auction!  It&#8217;s all designed to get me to up my sealed bid&#8230; whether or not there are even any other bidders.</p>
<p><ins>Note: One other thing I forgot to mention is that before the name dropped, I grabbed all .net, .org, and .info variants (all were available) in order to have more leverage over other buyers.</ins></p>
<h3>The chase is on</h3>
<p>Right on time, 75 days after the domain expired, I got an e-mail from Pool.com telling me they&#8217;d secured my domain for me.  Great.  Of the four sources I used, Pool.com was the one I <em>least wanted</em> to deal with.  But true to their claims, they ended up being the best agent of The Drop and had just gotten me one step closer to my domain.  They had A-Rod and I was the Texas Rangers.</p>
<p>Unlike the Texas Rangers, however, I realized I could be bidding against myself and entered a sealed bid of $302.  I chose that number because it seemed sufficiently high but not so high that I&#8217;d feel foolish if I was the only bidder.  I added the extra two dollars on the end just to edge out any other people potentially deciding on $300 as their number.</p>
<p>The next three days were particularly stressful.  I had no idea where I stood, and throughout this entire process, I&#8217;d always had the sneaking suspicion that the people at these companies are on the lookout <em>themselves</em> for valuable domains.  In other words, if someone all of a sudden bids $1000 on a domain, will a domain company decide to snatch it up themselves or &#8220;shill bid&#8221; against you on it?</p>
<p>Finally the e-mail from Pool arrived and informed me that I had moved onto the Challenger Auction.  There was one other bidder and they had upped their bid to $312 in order to beat me.  Not too bad, but I had no idea how high that person was willing to go.  I had to decide on a top bid (a la eBay&#8217;s proxy bidding) and a strategy for when to place it.</p>
<p>True to form, Pool.com&#8217;s auction system squeezes even more money out of you by making sure the auction doesn&#8217;t end if there&#8217;s a bid in the last five minutes.  In that case, the auction time keeps extending by five minutes until there are no more bids.</p>
<p>I could try one of two things:  Bid high and bid early in an attempt to scare off the other guy, or lull the other guy to sleep by doing nothing until the last 6 minutes.  I chose the second method since the ending time was 8am on a Saturday&#8230; a time when many people are not in front of computers.  I set four alarms for 7:45am Saturday morning, woke up on time, and placed my bid for $500 when the countdown clock hit 6 minutes.</p>
<p>The system immediately auto-upped the current bid to $369 and I was the leader.  Six nervous minutes, fifty browser refreshes, and a thousand heartbeats later, my opponent was nowhere to be found and the domain was mine&#8230; ready for immediate transfer to Dreamhost, <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/dreamhost-web-hosting" target="_blank">my hosting company of choice</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not quite sure whether the person on the other end was real (although I assume they were), but the bottom line is that by playing every possible angle, I now have an extremely valuable domain in my possession for the reasonable sum of $369.  Not valuable because I want to sell it or anything; just valuable because I want it.</p>
<p>Thank you Pool.com.  I love/hate you.</p>
<h3>Lessons from The Drop</h3>
<p>Hopefully this article helps you in your own quest for a domain that may be expiring.  My best advice is that if your interest in a domain name is only lukewarm, go ahead and use a basic service like GoDaddy, but if you really don&#8217;t want to let one get away, you must enlist the services of the big three: Snapnames, Enom, and Pool.  It&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s guess what the final price will be, but by getting all the best agents out there working for you, you ensure at least being in the game.</p>
<div class="update"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Both Mason Cole of Snapnames and Chris Ambler of Enom have written in to clarify a few points which I&#8217;d like to post here &#8211;
<ul>
<li>Snapnames has an exclusive partnership with Network Solutions which allows them first shot at any and all expiring domains that are currently held by Network Solutions. The domain I got was not held by Network Solutions but a great many are. If yours is, Snapnames is your best bet. You&#8217;ll still have to bid against any others who may be after the same domain, but the auction process at Snapnames is pretty fair and straightforward. If you are the only bidder, it will cost you a flat fee of $60.  Not bad.</li>
<li>Snapnames is actually not technically a newcomer to the game, but their exclusive deal with Network Solutions is fairly new and it is that which has made them a powerhouse.</li>
<li>According to Chris at Enom, some less than savory registrars have been known to actually cut the initial 40 day grace period down manually with the intent of repossessing the domain for resale. While this is technically against ICANN guidelines, ICANN has a hard time enforcing its rules on registrars, so just beware when watching for a domain that it may enter the redemption period quicker than you expect. It&#8217;s rare, but it can happen, especially with a non-established registrar. This could shrink the 75-day window down to potentially 35 days, and it could also screw you out of your own domain should it expire on you.</li>
<li>Chris also confirmed my suspicion that manually trying to snag a domain during the drop is all but impossible if any professional drop catchers are going after it.  Enom, Pool, and others have many orders of magnitude times the amount of resources that private citizens have so it&#8217;s not even worth trying unless you&#8217;re going after an uncontested domain.</li>
<li>There is a very sticky issue going on right now with regards to how names drop. Verisign proposed a Waiting List Service a little while ago that basically let you sign up on a waiting list for all expiring domains. It was a flat-rate, first-come-first-serve service where the fees were reasonable but Verisign controlled the whole thing. This would based eliminate The Drop entirely. Companies filed lawsuits and the thing never happened. So basically, registrars got proactive and amended their agreements so that when your domain expires, they can repossess it themselves or sell it as their own. This is what allows Network Solutions, GoDaddy, Tucows, and others to repossess their own domains and use their own services (like Snapnames) to auction them off. An argument can be made that by eliminating the ICANN-mandated redemption grace period, these companies are in violation of their ICANN agreements, but thus far ICANN has been reluctant to take action. It appears ICANN is generally very slow at taking action with <em>anything</em>, so it looks like this sort of practice may become a de-facto standard. The moral of the story is that you should always look to see what registrar the domain you&#8217;re after is under and see if they offer exclusive backorder rights to it. Network Solutions does, GoDaddy does, Tucows is starting to, and others may follow suit.</li>
</ul>

			<p>Interesting story&#8230;</p>
<p>And I guess I&#8217;ll ask the question everyone will want to know at this point &#8211; what&#8217;s the domain name (although I&#8217;m assuming if you wanted to share you would have)?</p>

			<p>Thanks for that article, Mike!  Ironically, I was just wondering this weekend what it would take to snatch up a domain that expires, as I am impatiently waiting through the next two months to see if one that I&#8217;ve had my eye on for several years will be renewed&#8230;</p>

			<p>Fascinating. My next move would be to consult my friend who is a class action attorney.  If in fact there was any shill bidding, you might have a decent case.  If they did it to you, they did it to others, and they would deserve a bit of a poke for it.  They probably have a subsidiary that bids on all open names.  The ethics of this would be a fun study.</p>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s Note:  Yeah, I&#8217;d say it was more of just a general feeling of being taken than any foul play, but who knows.  On the one hand, I have a crazy amount of respect for a bidding scheme which produces such results, but on the other hand, you just kind of feel a bit powerless and in the dark the whole time.)</em></p>

			<p>Fascinating story. I&#8217;ve never actually looked into the process before. Whenever I try to get a domain, I don&#8217;t even bother with trying to grab a domain currently in use, so I end up finding an alternative. I lack the patience and monetary support to go after high value domains, unfortunately.</p>
<p>And what a secret your new domain is. The anticipation is killing me!</p>

			<p>I too wanted to boost an expired dinosaur domain and asked the manager of my server to see if he could get it for me.  His response was: &#8220;What typically happens these days is the registrars have relationships with auction houses and transfer the domains to them&#8230; It&#8217;s pretty rare when they just get dropped for anyone to register them now.&#8221; </p>
<p>True to what he said, at the last minute the domain was re-registered.</p>

			<p>Heh &#8211; been thru this myself, great fun, especially after setting up the site and finding out that Google had the domain penalized from the previous owner&#8230;</p>
<p>One year (and many reinclusion requests) later and it&#8217;s getting traffic. Yay.</p>
<p>There are some tricks to avoiding this whole process too, but they don&#8217;t get around the google trap&#8230;</p>

			<p>Interesting article. Now I understand how those bastards at Pool.com stole my domain after my hosting service when under. What I don&#8217;t understand is what is at the new domain. It looks like a page of spam. Check it out at <a href="http://www.frolicofmyown.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.frolicofmyown.com</a>. I guess it&#8217;s better than my old blog being replaced with porn, although that might happen yet.</p>

			<p>Another great service if you intent to acquire a domain name which is already registered and not going to be expire in the near future is a domain name brokerage service from a company called <a>sedo.com</a>.<br />
After paying 49$ for a quite profound domain valuation that gives you the idea of the domain&#8217;s fair market value, they try to acquire the domain from the current owner on your behalf.</p>
<p>Works great, I already had success with it&#8230;</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m glad you got your domain Mike. I&#8217;ve had two less successful experiences with domain registering.</p>
<p>One was where I was using a simple word and couldn&#8217;t get that as the domain. Initially it was owned by some random company in England, and instead of dealing with them I just got something else and forgot about it. A couple years later I checked it out again, then it was owned by a smallish ISP/hosting company. Fast forward again and that company was bought out by a much larger company. And now they just use it to redirect to their main site. Even though they have 0 affiliation with the domain name anymore. I tried contacting them, but their IT dept. said they had 0 interest in selling it.</p>
<p>The other one was where I ended up with a .net instead of .com. The .com is owned by a spammer as far as I can tell. Just directs you to some shifty search page. I saw it wasn&#8217;t getting renewed but naturally it got snapped up just before it was put into the first &#8220;expired&#8221; status.</p>
<p>I pretty much despise the current system where automated bots can register domains for spammers and stuff. Maybe we should all start to ignore .com for a while. ;)</p>

			<p>Excellent story, I just wonder if the domain was genuinely one that these firms would have been watching for, or were they only alerted to it by your registering to grab it &#8211; in other words, if you had been brave/reckless enough, could you have waited the extra few hours and gone through a &#8216;normal&#8217; domain registration service? Or if you had ONLY used GoDaddy, might the others not have bid? </p>
<p>Like you say, it has value because you wanted it, so as long as you&#8217;re happy that is all that matters, but if you were determined to just pay the minimum might you have got away with it? Of course if it was a single term high value name, they&#8217;d maybe have snatched it away anyway&#8230; and no way to find out. </p>
<p>Interesting case study for brand and risk management as it applies to domains!</p>

			<p>I had a good experience acquiring a domain name through a Snapnames auction. It&#8217;s very similar to eBay, where you see the bidders &#8220;names&#8221; and have a sense of how/when they are bidding. I located the domain I bought by browsing through Snapnames&#8217; l o n g list of soon-to-expire domains and putting a few on backorder. The whole process took less than a month.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how good a domain worth $369 is.<br />
but on one guess &#8230; you could be off with godaddy<br />
if you hadnot used the services of big3 &#8230;<br />
many domain names expire everyday they wouldn&#8217;t know<br />
which to snap up</p>
<p>&#8230;.. but then..we wouldn&#8217;t know who&#8217;s the best among them then&#8230;&#8230;thanks great story</p>

			<p>I realize that a great domain name can be a helpful marketing tool. Just as catchy phone numbers can help out John Q. Customer, such as 1-888-Best-Buy, domain names have the same power. Yet, I also believe that in coming years having a domain name that matches the company or site name will be a luxury. I tend to place less emphasis on the perfect domain name; as long as the name is easy to remember and it relates to the site itself, I say you have a winner.</p>

			<p>Nice info &#8211; thanks. I&#8217;ve been waiting for years to register a domain that I barely missed registering (my name). It was snatched up by someone in Korea and then fell off the map. It&#8217;s never been active (at least as a Web site) and only one WHOIS server even reports that it&#8217;s registered (whois.internic.net). That whois reports that it&#8217;s parked at Register.com and the status has been REGISTRAR-HOLD for years. I continue to call Register.com every 6 months (I have many domains registered with them) but they continually give me the run around. The funny thing is that the domain doesn&#8217;t even show up when I run the WHOIS at Register.com&#8217;s site. </p>
<p>Can a registrar keep a domain on HOLD indefinitely?</p>

			<p>This may have been mentioned, but I think this is important. I work for a<br />
domain registrar and know that ordering a backorder that is already registered through the same registrar that you purchase the backorder from GUARANTEES that the domain is yours (assuming of course, that the domain is not renewed or redeemed by the current owner.</p>

			<p>four:  I&#8217;m pretty sure that is not the case&#8230; at least with some registrars.  The domain I got was previously registered by enom.com and I backordered through enom.com.  No dice.  Enom failed at retrieving their own domain.  Pool.com got it.</p>

			<p>OK. I read through the legal agreements and could not find support for my argument. I work for godaddy (online tech support). I have been with them for about 6 months and know that we will guarantee that the backorder will be successful if the domain is already registered with us. This may not be the case with other registrars. </p>
<p>Also, I guess this is a (fairly) new policy (maybe since DEC04) based on a change in ICANN policy. I dont know what other registrars do, but have heard (from godaddy) that they are following suit as well.</p>

			<p>Four, I&#8217;ll have to take issue with what you said. My bloghosting service (bloghosts.com) registered and owned my old domain through GoDaddy. When they went under, I placed a backorder with GoDaddy. It failed to capture the name and GoDaddy said that there were no refunds.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also certain that this happened after DecO4.</p>
<p>Not that I have a complaint with GoDaddy. I registered my new domain with them and have been very happy with the service.</p>

			<p>Hi Four,</p>
<p>Careful we don&#8217;t mention you in the same breath as Mark Jen and the Stewardess :-)  Perhaps Bob Parsons could clear things up about GoDaddy&#8217;s stance over on his blog, you might suggest it to him.</p>
<p>I have a pending backorder with Godaddy as we speak.  The domain was renewed.  If I understood correctly, if after waiting a while this domain does not come available, I can switch and register a different domain name for $18.95 fee I paid, meaning that the cost to backorder is really only $10.</p>
<p>What Godaddy didn&#8217;t do was tell me if others were in line in front of me.  It seems to me you could have 20 people backorder the same name.  I don&#8217;t know if I am number one or number 20.  And if in fact this backorder thing with the same register works, pool.com may in fact backorder it as soon as they decide it has value, knowing that for the $10 investment they can extract several hundred from a guy like Mike, and perhaps several thousand for other names.</p>

			<p>Don:  If you successfully entered your backorder through GoDaddy it means you are the <em>only</em> person to backorder through GoDaddy.  They don&#8217;t accept multiple backorders on names.  Search for the name on GoDaddy and you&#8217;ll see that the &#8220;Backorder Now!&#8221; option is no longer available.  This is good, but as I spelled out in the article, don&#8217;t let it lead you to believe that GoDaddy will definitely be successful at grabbing it.  If someone else has gone through Pool, Enom, or Snapnames, chances are you won&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>Four:  It would definitely seem like good policy for companies to do as you say (offer their expiring domains with 100% certainty through their own backordering services) but from what I understand there are certain ICANN rules which must be followed.  Some of the rules, as I understand it, say that a registrar is not the &#8220;backup owner&#8221; of a domain.  Meaning, if a person lets a domain expire, their registrar does not then get to decide if they want to keep it and re-auction or repossess it.  They <em>must</em> go through protocol and release it the standard way.  I do, however, think that registrars probably break this rule quite often.  I think one commenter above pointed to a situation where someone had put a &#8220;registrar lock&#8221; on a domain for quite some time&#8230; this would probably be against the rules.  And finally, I think you&#8217;re probably right in that if a domain is registered by GoDaddy and you try to backorder through GoDaddy, you may have a slightly greater chance than you otherwise would, but unless they have documentation stating otherwise, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a slam dunk.  If you can provide wording to the contrary, please post it&#8230; would love to know.</p>

			<p>OK. Im fairly new to this and checked with some people at work. This is how I understand it. </p>
<p>First of all, Mike is right about Godaddy allowing only one backorder per domain. </p>
<p>Apparently if you place a backorder on a domain PRIOR to its entering the REDEMPTION period and the domain is not renewed, you will get the domain. Once the backorder is placed, a &#8220;mock-redemption&#8221; period ois created and the domain is not released to the registry (becasue it doesnt need to be as the domain will either be redeemed by the current registrant or captured by the backorder). Therefore, there really is no way (barring some kind of fluke or mistake) that the domain could be snatched up by another individual or registrar. </p>
<p>disclaimer and correction to cover myself: </p>
<p>1. Godaddy does not officially guarantee any backorders<br />
2. I am not an official spokesperson for Godaddy and was just trying to shed some light on this often misinterpretted and confusing subject.</p>

			<p>Greetings Mike:</p>
<p>Mason Cole here with SnapNames.</p>
<p>Very good article.  You&#8217;ve captured a lot of what consumers think about the &#8220;drop-catching&#8221; industry.  Back when Al Gore invented the Internet, he had a chance to make this a non-issue, but everyone was too busy thinking about just getting online and didn&#8217;t spend time creating a smooth, orderly domain name &#8220;redistribution&#8221; process.  That is what gave rise to services like ours.</p>
<p>First, a couple of minor corrections:  We&#8217;re not owned by Network Solutions.  They ARE one of our partners &#8212; in fact, we have an exclusive relationship that allows only SnapNames customers first access to expiring NetSol domains.  So if there&#8217;s a good Network Solutions name you want, check our site first.  Same with BulkRegister names and a couple of other registrars that will be signing on with us shortly.</p>
<p>SnapNames actually was the first in the market.  We launched our system in 2000.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right about how hard it is for customers to understand and use this &#8220;system.&#8221;  It&#8217;s not much of a system &#8212; you either have to know how to chase a name yourself, which is pretty unlikely, or use our service or a combination of us and others.  We&#8217;ve been trying to work with ICANN and others on a predictable, orderly and centralized system that everyone can understand and use on an equal footing, but dealing with ICANN and its participants is not always productive.  </p>
<p>Until we can get ultimate resolution, we&#8217;re at least trying to add some predictability with these partnerships.  If you put in a &#8220;backorder&#8221; with us, and it&#8217;s for a Network Solutions or BulkRegister name, you&#8217;re guaranteed to have a shot at it if the current registrant doesn&#8217;t renew.  There&#8217;s no cost to put in a backorder, and if you&#8217;re the only one interested in the name, it&#8217;s yours for $60 upon fulfillment.  If others want it too, we auction it among interested parties.</p>
<p>In our auction process, we avoid the kind of frustrations or suspicions you experienced.  We want you to have as much transparency into the auction process as you can, and shill bidding is never allowed.  There are rumors from time to time that shill bidding exists in our industry, but I hope that&#8217;s not the case &#8212; for our part, we won&#8217;t tolerate it.  </p>
<p>I hope that&#8217;s useful information on how the process works, at least on our side.  If you or anyone else have questions, I&#8217;m glad to answer them.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s Note:  Thanks for posting, Mason.  Great information.  I&#8217;ve amended the statement about your affiliation with Network Solutions in the article, and I appreciate the insightful post. I agree that SnapNames seemed like a very straightforward and transparent process&#8230; I just wish they were able to grab the name.)</em></p>

<p>REGISTRAR-HOLD usually mean the domain is in dispute, and will not be released until resolved.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working in the Registrar industry now for about 5 years, and there are different rules for each gTLD and ccTLD.</p>
<p>Mail me your questioned domain, i&#8217;ll look into it&#8230;</p>

			<p>As Mason pointed out, snapnames was the first on the scene. Pool has a lot of relationships with many foreign registrars to catch drops, and that is how they do so well.</p>
<p>This whole process represents a weakness, not a strength to the domain name registration system. ICANN is a largely ineffectual organization that needs to be done away with.</p>
<p>I actually have respect for the guys at snapnames. I however do not respect pool one bit for their entirely &#8220;closed&#8221; process that allows them to shill whenever they feel the need.</p>
<p>In fact, I have witnessed personally one high value name that they caught that _never_ went to auction. Seeing them breaking their own rules (if they have any) is enough to beware of&#8221;dirty pool&#8221; to me. They have lost me as a customer with the &#8220;two phase&#8221; nonsense that was implemented.</p>
<p>I know that they have already heard these complaints before, and it is indeed ripe for an attorney make them feel some pain.</p>
<p>I only found this blog because I was searching for &#8220;pool&#8221; and &#8220;shill&#8221; to see what the latest with them was.</p>

			<p>The drop game is an ever evolving beast, and the top catcher today may not be the best tomorrow. Snapnames about 2 years ago grabbed almost every valuable <a href="http://www.dropwatch.com" rel="nofollow">expiring domain</a>. At that time it was a $60 first come first served business model. But many things have changed during this time, and it is crucial for anyone interested in aquiring a specific domain to cover all bases and use all of the above mentioned services (<a href="http://www.pool.com/index.aspx?aff=R-AAAFM&#038;bko" rel="nofollow">Pool</a>, <a href="http://www.snapnames.com" rel="nofollow">Snapnames</a>, <a href="http://www.enom.com" rel="nofollow">Enom</a>, <a href="http://www.domainut.com" rel="nofollow">Godaddy or a godaddy reseller</a>) and also a few more (<a href="http://www.namewinner.com" rel="nofollow">NameWinner.com</a>, <a href="http://4domains.com" rel="nofollow">4domains.com</a>) depending on the extension of the domain. </p>
<p>The title of best drop catcher changes frequently because of the hundreds of  registrars involved. And almost daily, a few registrars change their alliances, and work for a different service. The more registrars working for a drop service, the better the chances of them aquiring the domain you want. There are many tricks, techniques, and formulas for estimating what you should bid, but these are secrets seldom revealed.</p>
<p>People that are trying to aquire <a href="http://www.dropwatch,com" rel="nofollow">expiring domains</a> often do much research into the past uses of the domain, weather it has linkpop (links from other websites), how popular the sites are that link to it, how many people searched for the domain or words that compile the domain in the previous month, weather a domain is listed in yahoo or dmoz, and what <a href="http://www.googlepr.com" rel="nofollow">Page Rank</a> the domain may have. I have even created <a href="http://www.dropwatch.com" rel="nofollow">an automated site</a> that compiles all of this data and more, Because there are still thousands of people chasing domains that do not understand the value of the domain they are after, or the traffic it may have. </p>
<p>Just like there are numerous companies that chase domains, there are also numerous companies that provide domain owners with a way to monetize these domains until they are developed. Most expired domains, have very targetted inherent visitors, looking for specific items, and these services (<a href="http://www.domainsponsor.com/tracker/ref.php?ref_id=1226&#038;s=0" rel="nofollow">Domains Sponsor</a>, <a href="http://dbbsrv.com/refer/1893043/10006461?b=100" rel="nofollow">Fabulous</a>, <a href="http://www.sedo.com/services/parking.php3?language=us&#038;partnerid=13637" rel="nofollow">Sedo</a>, <a href="http://www.afternic.com/index.php?ref_id=37994" rel="nofollow">Afternic</a>, <a href="http://domainhop.com/util/init_referral.cool?refid=146780" rel="nofollow">Domain Hop</a>, <a href="http://www.trafficz.com/default.asp?o=D" rel="nofollow">Trafficz</a>) all provide a way to get paid by advertisers that are looking for their products. The domain owner is paid for each click that a visitor makes to see one of these sites. (see <a href="http://www.parkingincome.com/" rel="nofollow">ParkingIncome.com</a> for more info)</p>
<p>With the increasing dollar amounts willing to be paid by these advertisers (through the <a href="http://parkingincome.com/" rel="nofollow">Pay Per Click Search Engines</a>), this is what is driving the value of expiring domains up. So if you are interested in a specific domain, use all of the above mentioned services, but be prepared to spend some serious cash if the domain (or traffic accompanying it) looks valuable. </p>

			<p>Excellent BLOG.  When I&#8217;m ready to start this process, I&#8217;ll be back here refreshing myself on the inside scoop of this shady process.</p>
<p>Actually I was just looking for a list of unregistered 4 letter domains and ended up here.  Still haven&#8217;t found that yet, though I saw one link to a guy who sells a list for $4.  Seems like there would be a place to go to find that information quickly.</p>
<p>Thanks Mike and Mason, for making this read a productive and useful one.</p>

			<p>Nice blog, very useful information. I once tried to get an expiring domain myself. Spent several hours on the Godaddy website using a crappy connection. After about 100 refreshes I was thrilled, I got it, the system said. It was a shortlived joy. I received an email that it was not mine after all. Why, I still don&#8217;t know. The original owner kept it.<br />
The post of &#8220;Expired domains&#8221; is definitely comment-spam in a very  smart way.  I checked out the website and not being &#8220;prepared to spend some serious cash&#8221; I noticed I won&#8217;t even see any info on whatever domains:)</p>

			<p>Nice information.</p>
<p>I did try to grab some expired domains myself using the deletedomain list but it seems that it is impossible to get those that were previously registered with Enom and GoDaddy. That is why I only keep track of domain names that were not registered with them.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t know that there are varying drop time too, as I normally try to register the domain name during the 6am gold rush period which is 6.45 pm our time.</p>
<p>Strangely, the .org .biz names are easier to get even though it may have alot of links. Anyone knows the reason?</p>
<p>Also even though country level domain names may be more expensive, it would be more worthwhile because it preserve its  pagerank when expired unlike the .com and .net names.</p>

The releasing registrar has little to do with your chances of aquiring an expiring domain during the normal drop process. That being said, as I mentioned previously the &#8220;Drop Game&#8221; is an ever evolving beast, and changes each day. Since Netsol and Bulk Register, starting working with Snapnames, Dotster with Namewinner, and Godaddy and it&#8217;s resellers, to have exclusive drops circumventing the normal drop process, the initial registrar has a lot to do with where you can win the domain. On exclusive drops domains can only be won, or bid on at the drop partner site of that registrar. There are still hundreds of registrars that follow the normal drop process, making it necessary to place an order at all dropcatchers, but I foresee this all changing within the next 3-4 months. Soon all registrars IMHO will be participating in exclusive drops, either for themselves or partnered with snapnames, or another drop partner.</p>
<p>And Mike thanks (I think), I love to educate people on domains because it is such a fun business, but at the same time am always looking to benefit from sharing when possible.</p>

			<blockquote><p>Strangely, the .org .biz names are easier to get even though it may have alot of links. Anyone knows the reason?</p></blockquote>
<p>.org .biz (and .info, .us) are known as &#8220;thick&#8221; registries. When a domain is puchased, or whois info modified the database they provide (whois) is directly updated in real time. Thefore lapse information is more accurate and purchasing more secure. Nothing is more problematic for a registrar when they take an order for a domain they think is avaliable, and fail to secure it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I really hope some conformity comes to this industry. Having to back-order through several companies is a pain. It&#8217;s like the wild west out there in this expired domains game.</p></blockquote>
<p>The industry has got 100% better since the dark days of 90s, where a .com would cost Â£75 ($130) and avaliable via fax only. When new registries are launched, there are tight rules regarding trademark, patents, sunrise and landrush. Basically, if you really really want and domain in a new registry, then you need the trademark. That is the surefire 100% guarentee you will get your domain.</p>
<p>I recall one company, accually store all domain searches, and pro-ordered the domain before the customer&#8230;</p>

			<p>Hi Mike</p>
<p>As many others have already stated excellent article. Although I must admit to not being that interested in snapping up that all important domain name &#8211; until of course I lose my current domain name &#8211; better make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen!</p>
<p>Can I propose that we actually have a bid to be the first person that you tell the domain name to. What I propose is that we all email you sealed bids and you take the best two bids and then we have to bid until we don&#8217;t want to go higher. That way the best bid gets to win!</p>
<p>Alternatively it could be like waiting for the last episode of 24!</p>
<p>Rich</p>

			<p>No offense, but that&#8217;s a colossal waste of money. I&#8217;m still mildly upset that I spent 10$ too much on my domain name &#8211; I went through GoDaddy, got one of the $2 .info names back during that deal, and spent $10 on some privacy thing that takes over your WHOIS &#8211; it worked, too, until it turned out I needed to get rid of the privacy thing so the DNS would work. I wasn&#8217;t refunded for it, which really sucked. Oh well&#8230; live and learn, I suppose.</p>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s Note: Interesting that you can proclaim something you know nothing about to be a &#8220;colossal waste of money&#8221;. If you are buying .info domains for two dollars and then complaining about paying an extra ten for privacy, I think we are in very different boats here.)</em></p>

			<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>INSPIRING STORY! After reading your guide to the ins and outs of the expiring domain game (of which I am becoming increasing addicted too) I went on dotster.com where they have a list of expiring domains for that day. My eyes were immediately drown to a GREAT.com domain name, I had a look on the who is database a found that all the other extensions for that domain were available so I snatched them all up.<br />
I took your advice and went to snapnames.com and put down a backorder for the crucial .com detention and after an anxious few hours I was shocked to realise that I had got the domain name for the minimum $60 dollar fee!!!<br />
Thanks for reading my story Ged Lightfoot.</p>

			<p>Oh bye the way isnt it obvious that your secret domain name is in fact: mikeindustries.com?<br />
it seems so simple when you think about it! everybody is wondering what it could possibly be when in fact it was this very site all along!<br />
I cant believe no body else has suggested it. </p>
<p>Am I right Mike? email me. Ged.</p>

			<p>On the topic of grabbing expiring domains I have discovered a little trick to increasing your chances ten-fold to get that prize domain. When a domain first expires it goes into what is called &#8220;REGISTRAR-HOLD.&#8221; While in that period the registrant can easily renew the domain for a small fee. After 1 to 45 days, if the registrant has not renewed his domain, the registrar can request a refund from Verisign, then the domain moves on to REDEMPTIONPERIOD. The trick is to backorder the domain before it moves to REDEMPTIONPERIOD. While in REGISTRAR-HOLD check the whois information to find the registrar. Then find out who backorders for that registrar. If you backorder with that registrar&#8217;s affiliate backorder service then you should have an outstanding chance of grabbing that domain. That is as long as the registrant does not renew it first. Many backorder services do keep the domains available for backorder and will automatically give it to you if the registrant does not renew it, but if you wait too long the registrar will request a refund and then youâ€™ll have to battle it out at the end. I know that GoDaddy does it this way. I have snatched up many valuable domains using this technique.</p>

			<p>The post and the comments have been very informative.  Thanks.</p>
<p>It took me over ten years to collect the main set of my domain name.   I first registered the .com in 1994 when registration was free but took six weeks for confirmation.  I picked up the .net around 1997 and the .us a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>The .org was owned by someone who contacted me a few months ago about buying it.  I was leery that he was going to try to gouge, but it turns out he asked less than I thought he should so I paid him more than he expected.</p>
<p>There are more TLDs, of course, but these are the main ones as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have been waiting for four years for a domain name which has now expired.  Call me crazy, but I am going to try to get it on my own.  I am curious what kind of odds people would give me for snagging it.</p>

			<p>Shockwave Rider:  If anyone else really wants the domain you&#8217;re going after, I give you a zero percent chance of snagging it on your own.  Seriously.  The only way you&#8217;ll get it manually is if no services are also going after it.  That said, if you don&#8217;t think anyone else is going after it, and you don&#8217;t mind losing it, you might as well try manually.</p>

			<p>If the domain has anyone else at all interested in it, and they backorder it at any of the dropcatchers, you do not stand a chance trying to hand register it yourself.</p>
<p>Each of these drop catching service (pool.com, snapnames.com, enom club drop, namewinner.com) have affiliations with multiple registrars. </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you visit <a href="http://www.Domainut.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Domainut.com</a> and try to register the domain at drop time (6 days after the date that the status was updated to pending delete at 2pm eastern for .com .net). Realistically you could copy the domain name, and press the submit button on a dsl or cable connection, maybe a total of 30 times a minute (I say this because you must wait for the page to refresh). Each of these dropcatchers has multiple registrar partners working for them. In other words the drop catcher rents the direct line to the central registry from each registrar. These drop catchers have been doing this for a long time, and can almost pinpoint the exact rotation that the daily expired domains will be released to the available domains pool. So they will know which domains will be released at which time (almost to the tenth of a second). Then using these multiple direct connections to the registry, they send thousands of register commands at that second from each of these registrars. </p>
<p>In a nut shell, if any dropcatcher has a backorder for the domain you want, you should also backorder it at all of these services. (You have waited 4 years, if you take a chance that noone else is chasing this domain, you may blow it). There is no way to tell if a domain is being backordered at any of these services by someone else, so decide for yourself weather the domain is worth $30 at enom or namewinner, $60 at snapnames or pool.</p>

			<p>Dear Mike,</p>
<p>I donÂ´t know how to thank you! With this fantastic article and a bit of luck, I got the domain I had my eye on for a long time. 60 Bucks and Snapname did it for me. You have to register at all big three and stick with it. Enom and Pool did not even bother to email and tell me theyÂ´d lost out. Snapnames was quick and very efficient. The tip on Sedo.com is good but it could mean you pay more, however they will do a good analysis of the name for you and really try their best to acquire the domain. I chanced it and waited and managed to get what I wanted. A bit of luck helped but I stayed focussed. You have to be passionate about it. Good luck to all for future acquisitions!</p>

			<p>Not only a well-written piece, but obviously one that has gotten a lot of attention (and kudos).  Here&#8217;s a squirrelly one for you.  I registered a domain, paid for the name and hosting the site, but set the admin contact as the guy who was to become a customer.  Built the bare bones of a web site, then waited on more material from the <i>customer</i>.  After a couple of meetings, numerous emails and phone calls, and TWO years, I still never got any additional material, and never got paid.  And because I&#8217;m not the Admin, I can&#8217;t do a thing about the domain name.  A shame, because the guy really had (has) something worth sharing with the world.</p>
<p>Unlike Mike&#8217;s <i>valuable</i> domain, this one is not particularly noteworthy.  Even so, I want it should the dormant <i>customer</i> ever get his act together.  It expires soon and I want some leverage for payment.  But Iâ€™m going to take my chances.  No bidding wars for me.  It either becomes available or it doesnâ€™t.  With well over 75,000 domain names expiring each month, the odds are on my side.</p>

			<p>Sorry to hear the typical &#8220;non-paying customer&#8221;. Way too many&#8230;</p>
<p>The admin contact shouldn&#8217;t count for much, like the tech contact, the Bill contact is usually the registrar so they add their % from the NIC fee, however the Reg contact is the one to have. </p>
<p>It might be a idea to try to transfer out to a registrar that does recognise the registrant as the auth name. (such as GoDaddy, but check it out first)</p>
<p>Registrars have high, first line,  staff turnover, so don&#8217;t trust everything they say&#8230;</p>

			<p>Great article. I&#8217;ve tinkered with designs privately and volunteered my time for some groups that already had domains, but I have yet to acquire my own. This article (and others that I&#8217;ve read) have solidified my feeling that there&#8217;s a lot more involved in domain registration than a first glance might indicate.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been reading your blog for very long, Mike, and I hope not to sound like too much of a newbie here, but do you have any good references regarding what to look for in a registrar and/or hosting provider? I still have many questions about the process, and I&#8217;m not sure who&#8217;s best at answering them. I also don&#8217;t want to post here at risk of annoying more experienced people, which I hope I&#8217;m not doing already. :)</p>

			<p>I am in stealth mode seeking to register an obscure domain name currently in redemption.  I have a US federal trademark on the name and actually use it in business unlike the current registrant.<br />
This stealth mode is so deep that I did not even inform the current lapsing registrant of my interest or my trademark.<br />
Today when I noticed the url did not work I limited myself to 2 searches of it using registrar pages to clarify its status.  I plan to do no more searches until the 75th day when it would typically be expected to become available for registration.<br />
Assuing that tens of thousands of names drop everyday and based on my ebay and live auction / bargain hunting experience I believe that the simple fact that I am interested in this domain is a very valuable piece of information that I should not let out.  Even if I just log onto any of the dropcatching services such as Pool, Snapnames, Enom, Godaddy and search for it I may be telegraphing my intention.  I may be allerting these very adept name catchers that it may have a value or I may be creating the value or elevating the price.  They may then be motivated to capture it and subject me to an auction in which case I will need to out bid the speculators, squatters as well as potential less diligent legitimate users.  As a trademark owner if anyone else gets the domain the date of my trademark registration will precceed their date of aquisition of the domain and I believe that this will enable me to use the ICANN UDRP policy to challenge the registration.  Of course this will be long and expensive and I might not prevail.  I would be willing to pay 250 plus dollars to get the domain and avoid this inconvienence and get my domain.<br />
Extending the ebay analogy I think I might need a sniping tool like Auction Stealer that will disclose my intent and my valuation at the time when it will do the least damage to my interests.<br />
Your comments and suggestions are welcome.<br />

			<p>In the good ole days (about 2 years ago) many people used desktop and server side scripts to catch expiring domains. But since then the professionals drop catch services have added to many direct connections to the central registry for one of these scripts to even have a small chance at beating them to the punch. Some of the services have even created their own registrars just to use the connection to grab expiring domains. There are still a few scripts being sold , but it&#8217;s a waste of money IMO. </p>
<p>any way, here they are if you feel like proving me wrong :P</p>

			<p>Thanks for an interesting and eye-opening post.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to sound like I&#8217;m insulting any of you or condemning your activities, but I now have some serious misgivings about the domain name process.  Mostly because it now seems so related to capitalism in general.  To borrow a phrase from Scott Adams, &#8220;I&#8217;m always amazed that a billion weasels trying to hose each other, i.e. capitalism, works so well.&#8221;  The commercialization of the &#8216;Net has already brought spammers and huge, intrusive ads and now it seems like it&#8217;s spreading to domain names.  I hope I&#8217;m not doomed into a bidding war once my domain is getting close to expiring.  What can I do to help ensure I can get it back without having to worry about this too much?</p>
<p>(- Steve -)</p>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s Note: Ummm, just renew your domain and you don&#8217;t have to worry about any of this! :)  )</em></p>

			<p>Mike,</p>
<p>First off, thanks for the helpful article.  It will serve as an excellent reference should this situation present itself in the future.</p>
<p>Second (and pardon the aside), I&#8217;ve always envied (and desired to directly copy, even if I haven&#8217;t done so&#8230;yet) the way you treat comments.  The background numbers on each comment are saliva-inducing.  In a good way.</p>
<p>Keep up the stellar work (on both counts).</p>

			<p>Godaddy paranoid security measures.</p>
<p>To Steve (# March 28, 2005 03:11 PM):</p>
<p>Just make sure you don&#8217;t let the domain expire and you&#8217;ll be fine. As long as I know nobody can steal it from you if you are dealing with a reputable registrar.</p>
<p>To everyone:</p>
<p>Be careful about godaddy.com when it comes to domain name renewal ( and everything else about them for that matter!!!) . They sent me a message saying that they couldn&#8217;t successfully charge my credit card and that they would automatically keep trying. They did keep trying and failed every time because one of the contact phone number was wrong.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t bother to warn me that repeated failed attempts would eventually result in my loosing the domain name.  </p>
<p>They should have contacted me directly to ask me to verify my credit card info instead of sending me these repeated automated messages &#8220;authorization failed, will try again on X date&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I paid the $80 and got the name back. Unfortunately it takes over 72 hours&#8230;can anybody tell me if Google will completely drop me on a crawl if my site is down or if I should be ok for a few days being offline?</p>
<p>PS.There is nothing wrong with my credit card by the way and I spend at least $2000 a month online with it with no problems including some lump sum payments to Google of up to $1000, a wrong cell phone number on my file doesn&#8217;t bother %99 of online merchants, I guess that godaddy.com is &#8220;special&#8221;.  A $9.20 domain renewal fee for a 4 years repeat customer and reseller is a substantial credit risk is  after all, requires pentagon security measures for sure&#8230;</p>
<p>If anybody wants to share godaddy.com horror stories let me know at <a href="mailto:info@novatranz.com">info@novatranz.com</a> :)</p>

			<p>The industry will soon envelope an all enclusive mantra that will most likely cut out the drop catcher and or backorder service provider all together. It&#8217;ll soon mean more of a reliance on keeping close tabs on Whois registrar info as opposed to the current drop market manifestation.<br />
Nice read and refreshing take on the industry though&#8230;great overview Mike.</p>

			<p>Bruno, </p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your godaddy experience. I just wanted to say that I have been happy with their backordering service. I am currently 1 for 2, got <a href="http://www.pokerpimp.com" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://www.pokerpimp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pokerpimp.com/</a> on a backorder but missed out on another one (the owner renewed).</p>
<p>I agree with Mike, that if it is a domain you really want use all the big boys. I like GoDaddy for the price $18.95, and if you don&#8217;t get that specific domain you can change hte backorder to another domain for free. Plus these domains were nice to have but I didn&#8217;t need them.</p>
<p>Great article, very helpful.</p>
<p>Grant<br />

<p>I agree, and recently wrote an article about this on my own blog. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.dropwatch.com/blog/?p=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropwatch.com/blog/?p=14</a></p>
<p>As I had stated previously, expired domains game changes so much and IMO each registrar will start to either conduct their own auctions or partner with a domain auction service for exclusive drops.</p>

			<p>Excellent article, well done.</p>
<p>I think I need a little help from the community here. Mentioned in the feedback was that if the domain you seek it registered with Tucows (amongst others), you need to use their backordering service, as it will come up on that first.</p>
<p>The domain I seek is with Tocows, but I cannot find any mention of backordering on their site.</p>
<p>Anyone know where it is? Or if their partner with a specific catcher?</p>

			<p>As an ex-manager and customer support staff for 2 registrars (same main company, 2 registrars) for over 2 years, your insight is right on. And your comment responders are damn smart as well. The deletion/drop game is hard to wrap your head around, and many of our clients just didn&#8217;t get it right. Then, ICANN had to go and add the whole redemption period extra, which is another racket by the registrars (registry cost for this was around $50 just a year ago). </p>
<p>I&#8217;d still be on top of all the details if it wasn&#8217;t for WLS. Our registrar biz was small, and the bulk of the operating capital came from reselling our Pool 3 (as the dropped names service is called to the registry) connection to one of these businesses. The owner was scared WLS was about to take over the monthly fees, and he dropped me like a bad habit, reducing staff to a vacant owner and a cheap Indian programmer. Needless to say, I&#8217;ve enjoyed watching their descent from afar.</p>

			<p>Hi Chris, I think he was referring to when a domain will drop. At first glance, I thought the same thing, that he was asking when the current domain system would change. </p>
<p>Dave, have a look at this article</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dropwatch.com/blog/?p=8" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropwatch.com/blog/?p=8</a></p>
<p>it should shed some light on the drop process, and when u should see the domain your waiting for to be released.</p>

			<p>Deleted Domains (et. al):<br />
Any idea of when we&#8217;ll see the end to the current drop system? I have a domain that I&#8217;m waiting on expiration &#8211; hoping that I&#8217;ll finally get it someday.</p>
<p>Check the WHOIS on the domain in question Dave. Knowing that, you&#8217;ll be ahead of the game by a country mile because in many cases it&#8217;ll point to who you should be backordering with in the first place, as exclusive memberships between catchers and registrars continue to flourish. eg (Registrar) Dotster &#8211; ( DropCatcher) Namewinner, (Registrar) BulkRegister &#8211; SnapNames.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

 how can I use your instructions if my interest is link popularity and not just the name of the domain?</p>
<p>There are numerous services that provide list of expiring domains. But there are only a few that provide stats for these lists of domains. My service (dropwatch.com) provides detailed stats, including linkpop, overture, google pagerank, alexa rank, wayback archive and more. </p>
<p>This is a great way to find domains that are available, onhold, in redemption, or pending delete, that are targetted towards your industry or certain products that you are selling. Which helps to improve your sales conversion ratio with highly targetted traffic. </p>
<p>Many website owners fail to see this light and don&#8217;t truly understand. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Many advertisers are happy to pay $1.00 for a highly targetted visitor to google or overture. They do not realize that google and overture are getting a majority of these highly targetted visitors from expired domains that were caught at the drops. </p>
<p>Once the advertisers start to understand this two things will start to happen. Advertisers will start purchasing these domains from the owners and start catching domains themselves at the auctions. </p>
<p>It only makes sense to cut google, overture, and the other middle men out of the equation. It&#8217;s a simple way to start paying less for the highly targetted traffic, and make the domain owners more. (since the middleman is cut out of the equation)</p>

			<p>Well, I&#8217;ve started my own journey into this back-order fiasco.  I&#8217;m up and running with SnapNames, GoDaddy, and Pool.  I&#8217;m hoping I get this domain, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>

			<p>I agree with Chris. Enom and also Namewinner.com should be added to your list. All of the abontioned catchers are pay for perfomance, so backordering at multiple services only makes sense to cover all bases.</p>

			<p>HI,<br />
  Awesome post! I recommend that you use all of the drop catchers to ensure you get that domain name that you really want.</p>
<p>If you have any domain names that might be potentially good ones, meaning hey get traffic or have a poential to be resold i recommend that you use sedo and follow this link to get paid on your traffic <a href="http://www.sedo.com/services/parking.php3?language=us&#038;partnerid=16189" rel="nofollow">http://www.sedo.com/services/parking.php3?language=us&#038;partnerid=16189</a></p>
<p>I had a name that i would have sold for $10 dollars and currently receive $40 per month from it. Pretty good for an $8 investment</p>

			<p>Sedo does pay well on some names, but depending on the keywords that the audience or keywords that the domain is targetted to, you would do best by checking <a href="http://www.parkingincome.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.parkingincome.com</a> to see which service (pay per click search engine) is paying the best for your specific type of domain.</p>

			<p>Very interesting article.  I have been curious about snagging expiring domains.  I too am curious as to the domain name.  But like a previous visitor mentioned, it is irrelevent.</p>
<p>BTW, I found this website after searching for free ipod information.<br />
So even if I don&#8217;t get a free ipod, I did get to read this article.  What a great find!  </p>
<p>I will be back.</p>

			<p>Just a comment on the partnership agreement between SnapNames and Network Solutions.</p>
<p>I registered with Snap well before the drop of a name I&#8217;d been watching for a long time, I&#8217;d even instigated the drop by making a complaint to Internic about the contact details for the name.</p>
<p>After waiting patiently through the dropping process I receive a mail form SnapNames stating that the &#8216;registration attempt was unsuccessful&#8217; &#8211; how can this occur when they have a fulfillment agreement?</p>
<p>Looking up the new owners of the name I find that Pool had picked it up and it was now going into their auction list, I was told Network Solutions was looking into the matter but this only ment they were stalling until the name was sold and irretrievable.</p>
<p>At no point was there any forthcoming information as to what was actually being investigated or done about the issue and at the end of the matter all there was was a &#8216;sorry&#8217;.</p>
<p>Not acceptable.</p>

			<p>Great piece, Mike. Thanks also Expired, Deleted and others.</p>
<p>Special kudos to KWH for the post about being in &#8220;Stealth Mode.&#8221;</p>
<p>KWH&#8217;s suspicions correctly reflects my own bitter experience. I am a US trademark owner and user of a registered Tradename for 25 years. A giant .com nailed my site name in &#8217;95. I waited patiently for it to expire because they weren&#8217;t using it. When it did, I was completely locked out of the process of even trying to be able to bid on it because &#8220;somebody&#8221; had moved in and &#8220;reserved&#8221; it within minutes. That somebody was one of my competitors. They didn&#8217;t even use the site for a year or so, then had a sister firm &#8220;use&#8221; it as a front door page.</p>
<p>I complained to ICANN, and tried to initiate an appeal process, even tried to prepay the fee that was required, but received a curt reply suggesting my complaint had no merit.</p>
<p>This was a couple of years ago. I&#8217;m sure things have become only more shady and corrupt in the interim.</p>
<p>One other point. KWH suggests NOT seaching for the name you want because SURELY these smart insiders know how to track who is searching for what and how to grab a name anybody else may be interested in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Expired Domains&#8221; replied that KWH was &#8220;a little too paranoid.&#8221; </p>
<p>But then I looked at &#8220;Expired Domains&#8221; own website and found this exchange:<br />
Domainut: yep, itâ€™s a cutthroat game, but espionage is needed to succeed in this biz, sharing too much info can cut ur chances of surviving<br />
clemzonguy: well iâ€™ve been fed wrong information beforeâ€¦</p>
<p>With all due respect, Expired Domains, are we really supposed to believe your comment that KWH is &#8220;a little too paranoid?&#8221; Or should we instead coclude this is a bit of MisInformation, in the light of your own words that  &#8220;itâ€™s a cutthroat game, but espionage is needed to succeed in this biz, sharing too much info can cut ur chances of surviving.&#8221; </p>
<p>Just wondering.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this entire threat has been a fabulous and enlightening read. Many thanks to all.</p>

			<p>Sharing information is my end of the business. I capitalize on this area of the drop game. Why? Because first and foremost, I am a developer that earns a large majority of my income from developing tools to allow my members of DropWatch.com to see the true values of each domain, then secondly I am a speculator. Why do I believe in sharing this info? Because as also stated in the same blog.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
<p>So, as to your question, Yes my comment was my actual opinion. First he would need to understand that there are hundreds of people and a few dozen services that have access to the zone files. Which provide much information, if decyphered correctly,  to let you know which domains are expiring. If the name is valuable, he probably won&#8217;t be the only one that knows about it, or has plans on persuing it. </p>

			<p>Not sure how your reply is a response. I wrote about domain name speculators sharing DISinformation. You replied about sharing information.  </p>
<p>I also raised a question about the wisdom of repeated testing for the availability of a domain name.</p>
<p>WhoIs inquiries surely keep records, and I don&#8217;t doubt those records are &#8220;made available&#8221; to the right people for the right price, because when they come up empty, they indicate which domain names somebody out there may be planning to register.</p>
<p>Further, when we enter an URL in our browser for a site that doesn&#8217;t exist, we are redirected to any number of advertising sites set up specifically to catch such situations. I don&#8217;t doubt these sites cull such failed attempts, looking for where the user is obviously seeking the same top level page in each of the TLDs for the same root name. And I wouldn&#8217;t doubt that people in your business can subscribe to reports of such attempts. </p>
<p>Given the near insignificant cost of speculative registrations, wiley experts in your business can move to reserve such names.</p>
<p>I realize you work hard to score big. But it still adds up to the fact that it&#8217;s hardly paranoia to suspect that attempts to repeatedly test for the existence of a site name will likely lead to a speculator reserving it.</p>
<p>Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that. Fishing is a fine sport. Unless you&#8217;re a fish.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

			<p>ParkingIncome.com is up to date and as accurate as possible to be while still complying with terms of google and overture by the programs that we report on. The data is updated daily. There are currently 30 privately invited members reporting their stats from over 100,000 domains. These domains have been tested at different services, and more domains as you can imagine are added to their portfolios, and are added. </p>
<p>The concept behind ParkingIncome.com is to show which program will perform the best for each keyword. The reason that I launched this site, was to show a collective average payout for each service on each keyword. As for your statement about PI not being updated, I run the site and disagree, as for accuracy, it may not be 100% accurate, may differ from your results, but all in all it uses the closest formula possible to provide the most accurate results.</p>
<p>Sid</p>
<p>It is proven that no one service will perform the best 100% of the time on each keyword, so ParkingIncome shows which programs should perform the best for each domain in your portfolio.</p>

At one time I tried to register one of our company&#8217;s expiring domains. I&#8217;m not sure how soon I could re-register for the expiring domain, but I had tried it and I thought it was 2 months later, I could re-register for the domain.<br />
That means anybody can snatch an expiring domain 2 months later if it has not been re-registered.</p>

			<p>buddy, i read your page and i sincerely wish to thank you for having it online.</p>
<p>i search for this exact info and your was perfect.</p>
<p>by using your info as a guide i managed to pick up a domain name of very significant value in an industry worth 17 billion dollars.</p>
<p>had been waiting patiently for 8 years to secure this name by doing it manually every time it came close to being available without success and after doing as you said i picked it up without an issue.</p>
<p>bloody brilliant !!!</p>
<p>all the best wishes,</p>
<p>mark b.</p>

			<p>Way back in 1999, I lost a valuable .com business name to some japanese company; at the time there didn&#8217;t seem to be no reason to hurry to secure a domain name.</p>
<p>When I was ready to get it, I was late by one month (!) and had to check regularly and wait 6 long years for expiration. </p>
<p>Thanks to your very informative article, I&#8217;ve back-ordered it via Snapnames and finally won the auction for $525 ! Not too bad, I tell you.<br />
How stressful the whole process was ! </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way I could have find all those information by myself; I would certainly missed that precious domain name again if I didn&#8217;t follow your advice. I used the same kind of strategy for bidding.</p>
<p>Thanks again !</p>

			<p>I am trying to backorder a new with Snapnames.com. It seems they have system running who bids up with me. When I place a higher bid, the system place a 5 dollar bid 2 seconds after. So it looks like I am bidding against the computer. I donÂ´t know if I am going to continue or go to give up.</p>

			<p>someone is killing me in the search rankings for my industry by getting dmoz and yahoo listed domain names that are &#8216;technically&#8217; expired to rank well for dozens of keywords.</p>
<p>i say &#8216;technically&#8217; because he&#8217;s somehow getting them from a registrar without before they officially expiring &#8230;. when you check it in the whois, it doesn&#8217;t show that it expired at all. so it&#8217;s beating google so damn easy too.</p>
<p>most of his sites seem to be registered through netsol but i have no clue if this is who gave him the domains before they expired.</p>

			<p>Netsol is currently partnered with snapnames, and the domains are not really deleted from the registry and do not follow the normal delete process. These domains are renewed by netsol if they have at least one backorder at snapnames, then transferred to the winning bidder after the auction. All of the new exclusive drops are doing this and the search engines have no way to tell if the domains were deleted, so they will continue to hold their PR and ranking until the linkpop gets taken down, the next rawl by the serps and find different content to grade the site by, or find a non existant site. </p>
<p>Many of my members chase expired domains in specific categories, simply to aquire their page rank, search rankings, or search engine listings, and that is why we offer the lists of domains that are expiring, in redemption and on hold domains along with detailed stats from overture, linkpop, google pr, yahoo and dmoz listed etc&#8230; </p>
<p>Expired domains can create so much traffic for so many different reasons and can be used to develop a new site, or better yet drive targetted traffic to your already developed site.</p>

			<p>Wow!  What an incredible article and thread.  it took me an hour to completely read and attempt to digest all the information.</p>
<p>I would like to ask a couple of questions which may have been asked but the answer was not clear to me.<br />
- I am interested in purchasing a domain name currently owned by another.  There is no website associated with this link.  The owner seems to have purchased several domains with similar types of names and I guess he is waiting for someone to pay him to transfer.<br />
- The domain I am interested in is about to expire.</p>
<p>1.  Can my search for the url be tracked even when a site does not exist?<br />
2.  Are my searches using WhoIs and other domain registrars tracked?  If they are tracked, does the current owner receive information that his/her site is being investigated?<br />
3.  If I register with a company like SnapNames for a back order, will the current owner know that there has been a back order placed?</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply.  Thanks.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been through similar domain adventures.  However, since you bring up a sense of distrust with the system (which I share), allow me to share an event that was eye opening.  I was trying to register an expired domain on my registrar one day, and for some reason when I would get to a certain point, my browser would freeze up&#8230;(found later to be virus in explorer), since I though it was my registrar having problems (it was actually my computer), I went to godaddy to use friends account which was already in place, and godaddy says the &#8220;domain isn&#8217;t available at this time however you can backorder the domain&#8221;!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
Wow!  (obviously for more money)&#8230;   So I went back to my registrar, and verified the whois, then to a different registrar,<br />
set up a brand new account, and within 2 minutes I had the domain, that godaddy wanted to charge me a backorder fee for!   </p>
<p>I definetly don&#8217;t trust godaddy after that experience.</p>

			<p>Can I ask you guys- I&#8217;m in a similar situation in that the domain I want is due to expire in a day, and I am considering doing all three- snapnames.com, pool.com, and enom.com.  My question is&#8211; if I&#8217;m the only one backordering the domain, then aren&#8217;t I bidding against myself being able to get it for $60.  In other words, whereas I might have been able to get the domain for $60 by back ordering with just one service; wouldn&#8217;t I definitely have to bid in an auction if I did it with all three backordering services?  Thanks!</p>

			<p>Each different service conducts their own auction if they catch the domain.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you backorder a domain with pool, enom, and snapnames. If snapnames catches the domain on the day that it drops, that means that only snap names can award the domain to one of the people that backordered at snapnames. </p>
<p>(If someone else backordered the domain at enom and pool, bu not at snapnames, then that person no longer has a shot at aquiring the domain)</p>
<p>If you are the only person that backordered the domain at snapnames and they catch it, then you win the domain for $60. If more than one person backordered it at snapnames, then an auction begins (but includes only people that backordered the domain at snapnames). </p>
<p>This holds true for all three of the above mentioned services. The service that catches the domain will auction it off and your bids at the other services are then null and void.</p>

<p>Can I ask you guys&#8211; this domain I want was registered I believe through AAAQ.com via Hostway.com &#8230;.who can I back order with that the domain would be released to?  Hostway does not even provide a back order service, and neither does AAAQ.</p>

			<p>Julie, don&#8217;t let <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/how-to-snatch-an-expiring-domain#4805" rel="nofollow">your experience with GoDaddy</a> give you a bad impression of them.  The reason the name wasn&#8217;t available when you returned to the site is that it was already in your cart.  They hold it for you in your shopping cart until you checkout &#8211; this is actually a good thing because once you select a name no one else at godaddy can select it just after you and beat you to checkout.  What you needed to do was go to the bottom of the page and follow the link for &#8216;Cart&#8217;, and it would have taken you to the checkout page with the name in your basket.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m interested in a name that was registered through Registerfly.  They have a backorder service called DropFly.  By backordering the name through them, is it one of those exclusive situations where I&#8217;m pretty much guaranteed the name?</p>
<p>Also, I backordered the name a couple of days after it went into redemption period.  In order to qualify for the exclusive status, does it have to be backordered before it goes into redemption?  From one of the earlier posts it sounds like it does but I wasn&#8217;t sure.</p>
<p>Third, since RegisterFly is an Enom reseller, how does that effect all of this?  Should I do the backorder at Enom too or am I fine just doing it at RegisterFly?</p>

			<p>I have my eye on a certain .NET domain that&#8217;s currently in redemption.  I&#8217;ve already backordered it with the registrar where it was previously registered as well as GoDaddy; and I&#8217;m debating whether it&#8217;s worth the extra $40+ to take the Enom/Snapnames/Pool route as well.  I understand this is like playing a hand of poker, but I wish there were a way to know whether others will be as interested in this domain as I am.  I wish I knew more than I do about the domain speculative market.  Is it possible to valuate a domain without tipping off to others that I&#8217;m interested in it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stop posting now.</p>

			<p>If I backorder my domain through Club Drop and I manage to land it, at which registrar will it be registered. I&#8217;ve heard horror stories (confirmed in the comments to this post) about bidders getting their desired domains only to find out that they have been registered at a registrar in a foreign country and all their correspondence is in a foreign language.</p>
<p>On the flip side, when a registrar rents it&#8217;s ICANN connection to a company like Club Drop, does that registrar get all successful registrations that result from that connection or is Club Drop the registrar on record for those domains.</p>

			<p>Alright Mike, you&#8217;re the man. I read this when you originally posted it months ago, and referred to it about 6 weeks ago when I wanted to pick up a fairly decent domain that was expiring.</p>
<p>Gratefully, I didn&#8217;t have to go through the auction process as I was the only one going after the domain it seems. That said, Pool.com got me what I wanted today.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the man.</p>

			<p>Today I successfully snagged a .ORG that I&#8217;ve had my eyes on for almost a year.  Yeah!  (GoDaddy&#8217;s backorder service got it for me.)  .ORGs don&#8217;t seem to be in high demand among the domainers, but it&#8217;s a big catch for me &#8212; I&#8217;m very psyched.</p>

			<p>Great article, Pool.com has always been the best but it really depends on which company registered the domain prior to it being expired/dropped. I also found out the hard way that many other people also want a domain that is expiring even though it is potentially useless.</p>

			<p>Sounds like a looter mentality &#8212; take stuff not for any good reason other than that it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>The .ORG domain that I got through godaddy&#8217;s backorder was previously registered at godaddy, but that didn&#8217;t matter because I didn&#8217;t backorder it until after it went into the pending delete phase (last 5 days).  So anyone could have gotten it if they had tried.  I was lucky and got it because no one else apparently wanted it.</p>
<p>The .NET that I still am waiting to get was previously registered at Registerfly and it showed that in the whois records.  But sometime within the last couple of days the whois record changed to show Enom as the previous registrar.  Whatever.  I backordered it with Registerfly 2 days after it went into redemption, so I&#8217;m pretty sure I missed out on the exclusive status.  And even if I had done it on time I don&#8217;t know if it would have helped because registerfly seems a bit flaky.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m most likely going to backorder the .NET with each of the big 4 dropcatchers.  Paying $60 seems high for a .net that probably no one except me wants, and I could probably get it for only $20 with Godaddy, but at this point it&#8217;s worth paying top dollar just to not have to think about it any more.  Going after expired domains can consume a lot of time.  Lately it seems like all I do is check whois records and statuses, etc, when I should be building websites instead.</p>
<p>By the way, ClubDrop charges a $30 registration fee in addition to the $30 backorder fee, so their total is $60 just like Pool and Snapnames.</p>

<p>Is <b>.INFO</b> an essential domain now?  It used to be that .com, .net, and .org were the only &#8220;real&#8221; domains, and the others like .info, .biz, and .ws were there just to tempt us into giving more money to the registrars.  Sure they served a purpose, but most people didn&#8217;t consider them very desirable.</p>

How on God&#8217;s green earth did you manage to get a so-called &#8220;<em>good</em>&#8221; domain for only $369?  Based on my experience in the after market, good domains routinely go for over $1000, and often in excess of $2000 and $3000.  Consider yourself blessed if you only paid $369 for your dream domain &#8212; it was a bargain.</p>

			<p>Many changes are underway in the industry. As mentioned numerous registrars are beginning to retain worthy domains and conduct their own private auctions. When you find a domain that is expiring and you are interested, make sure you research the current registrar to see if they conduct their own private aution, or if the domain will follow the normal drop procedure.</p>

			<p>Any idea how register.com handles soon to expire domain name?  Do they have a relationship with one of the dropcatchers?  I find no backorder facility on their website, so I have no idea if they provide that service and whether or not a backorder would provide preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

			<p>Great article.  What criteria do bulk registrars use to decide whether to pick up an expiring domain?  Do they look at it&#8217;s Google pagerank?  Any other quantitative measure?  Or do they just grab ones they think will look good?</p>
<p>In short, is there a good way to know how much competition you will have?</p>

			<p>Well in this case the author was pursuing a particular expiring domain, but for those of us &#8216;Name Miners&#8217; just looking for good investments I offer the following story.</p>
<p>I have been buying and occasionally selling reasonable dot comâ€™s for a while now. Due to an extraordinary gift of word-play, rhyme and slang, plus a lot of hours, I have no problem sourcing above average two word domains for resale.  I have never resorted to playing the â€˜expiring domain gameâ€™. Recently I put it to the test. I manually browsed through a long list of expiring domains, made a note of the top100 I would register at first time registration rates.  Months later I checked the 100 names I had selected and 56 were available.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is I could register all 56 domains for the prices of possibly catching 3, 4 or 5 of the other 46 domains buy way of backordering.</p>
<p>The 56 available names in my opinion were of equal quality to the 44 that were backordered or bid upon.</p>
<p>In my opinion this game was much more fun plus the 56 Domains I registered did not make a profit</p>

			<p>I read your article with interest. I am unsure though, if I should be using this approach for a domain that I want.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been really stupid, and not registered the .com variant of my my .org. A company seems to have grabbed it, and just have a filler page with adverts, and the like.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t that bothered before about having the .com, but now that someone else has it, it is bothering me a great deal. What if the content goes against what I&#8217;m trying to do with my .org? &#8211; Given the nature of my site, it would not be a total surprise if the content of the .com started to advertise products that I am very much against. &#8211; As I said, I&#8217;ve been stupid!</p>
<p>Anyway, I need a strategy. I don&#8217;t have money to burn I might add.</p>
<p>Do I just wait, and see, and hope, that it is not renewed? Do I approach the registrant, but alert them as to my interest? Is there another avenue, such as trademarking the name (comparitively expensive, and I don&#8217;t think it will work anyway)? &#8211; I&#8217;m unsure if arbitration can be used if you don&#8217;t have your name trademarked. From what I&#8217;ve read, it would appear not, and again, pretty expensive.</p>
<p>Anyone have some suggestion about other resources that might help me decide upon my approach?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of inclined to do nothing, and wait, especially after reading the previous entry by DOM-i-NIC.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

			<p>Thanks for that whole story, it gives some real tools for grabbing dropped domains. I might use that soon for 2 or 3 domains, that i hope will be dropped. </p>

			<p>Is $300 is a lot for a domain?<br />
Answer: how long is a piece of string?</p>
<p>A name can be gold dust or dross depending on what it is.<br />
How much would $300 buy you in a conventional real estate transaction?<br />
Business people/entrepreneurs(?) want to go online and start/augment their  business and then balk at a few hundred (or few thousand) dollars. Top domains have been sold for hundreds of thousands and occasionally millions of dollars.<br />
It&#8217;s easy to  sneari at those who snapped up domains but if we could put the clock back 10 years who wouldn&#8217;t grab music.com, wine.com or indeed sex.com(valued at 18 million dollars by a federal judge)?</p>

			<p>Mike..</p>
<p>Interesting article, and I guess my question is how does someone become a Ecom, or a professional domain catcher? </p>
<p>However, hw does one go about developing a program such as Ultsearch, and the man behind it, (not his real name from what I understand) Yun Ye..</p>
<p>See his story here..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.expiredtraffic.com/index.php?page=ultsearch" rel="nofollow">http://www.expiredtraffic.com/index.php?page=ultsearch</a></p>
<p>At the very least I would like to know what tools are out there to buy expired domains that I could turn into affiliate programs, and to drive traffic to my site.</p>
<p>I understand the basic concept of buying expired domains, I am just<br />
wondering what it takes to become a professional domain collector, or a traffic aggrator..</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Regards.<br />
Robert..</p>

			<p>Just like most things on the net its a very competative market being a domain collector. I know of some people that have written scripts that says which domains are expiring, when they are expiring, the google page rank on that domain and so on.</p>
<p>Now from what I know when lets say you buy a domain that had a PR of 6 when it expires you loose all the PR but the next time the page gets spidered (after someone has purchased it ) there is no reason the PR should not go back up to 6 if all the links are still there right?</p>
<p>If anyone knows abit more about this it would be great to know.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

			<p>If you realy seek for a domain with a standing high Google PageRank you should register and pay some pennies for an italian french or swiss domain name. </p>
<p>These domains are a little more expensive to register but there are lots of deleted domains which belong to nobody. Find a PR 6 domain for example at <a href="http://www.domainbroadcasting.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.domainbroadcasting.com</a> (they also check for you if the pagerank is mirrored or not) and register it. Put some textlinks on and one to your own domain and wait up to 100 days. It will bring you a push in your PageRank -1 than the domain you grabbed thatÂ´s almost for sure.</p>
<p>It will take only two google updates. Announcments could be find @ <a href="http://www.seocompany.ca/pagerank/page-rank-update-list.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seocompany.ca/pagerank/page-rank-update-list.html</a></p>
<p>Expiring domains means waitimg, deleted domains are already free to register.</p>

<p>I searched for medium PR domain names this morning at Network Solutions and found a few &#8212; then went to SnapNames to backorder them.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what happens &#8212; many expired domain traffic companies are searching 24/7 for new names to capture traffic from.</p>

			<p>I paid my domain renewal fee to my registrar on the day before it was due.  They didn&#8217;t sent the money in fast enough and told me there was no such thing as grace period.  They were to just re-register it when it came available.  Someone beat them to it.  Now a domain name shark put a search page on it and want to sell it for $1500.   This information is great&#8230; wish I had seen it sooner.</p>

			<p>I am looking at a domain name to register. It is currently expired and registered through NetSol. I can try the auction route though snapnames, but there is conflicting information in the whois record at least through whois.sc. It shows two different expiration dates, one in 09/2005 and another 09/2006. I&#8217;m wondering if maybe netsol has automatically extended it because there is another backorder in place? Its a relatively obscure domain name, so I was planning on taking my chances on it since I don&#8217;t want to escalate the cost. The current status is registrar-lock. it does say that the registrant is &#8220;Pending renewal or deletion&#8221;, ie, NetSol&#8230; pretty strange. Thanks!</p>

			<p>Wow, this post has great karma! Good job, I learned a lot from the post and the comments.</p>
<p>I had written a series of articles for eWEEK.com on domain theft (a separate matter, except inasmuch as they both demonstrate incompetence on the part of ICANN) and many readers responded to me with horror stories about how they forgot to renew their domains and somebody took them away, expecting sympathy from me. The stories I wrote about had to do with people who actually owned their domains having them stolen. </p>
<p>Moral of all these stories: read your e-mail from your registrar and renew your domain if it&#8217;s expiring.</p>

			<p>Nice article. I have been interested in domain names for quite some time, but it has still been very informative.</p>
<p>On my domain weblog I have written the story of buying a semiattractive deleting domain without using a backorder service. The price was $ 2.99, but it also was a bit of some gambling.</p>

<p>Could the build up be way too much for you to ever reveal the domain?</p>
<p>Is there some unknown danger in revealing it that we should know?</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be good to have a link to it from this page with a PR of 6?</p>

<p>3. Yes there is. If you follow my blog, you&#8217;ll know that I left Disney a few months ago to start my own company. The name of my company is the name of this domain. It will be revealed when we are dangerously close to launch.</p>
<p>4. No. My blog has a PR of 8 so I&#8217;m not worried about linking. It will happen when it&#8217;s ready.</p>

			<p>Extremely interesting and informative &#8211; I appreciate this info. I too, am on the &#8220;trail&#8221; of an extremely critical name for my organization and, unfortunately, have found out that the owner is leasing it &#8211; in telling him I wanted to buy it, of course he said it wasn&#8217;t for sale&#8230;but to pay MORE to lease it from him than his current &#8220;user&#8221; seemed very enticing. Worm factor applies to him for sure! Thanks again &#8211; great information and&#8230;I&#8217;ll be &#8220;tuning in&#8221; for the release of the &#8220;mystery name&#8221;!</p>

			<p>Wow..This thread keeps going, and going, and going! Talk about the Energizer Bunny! (LOL!)..However, while there has been some excellent &#8220;trains of thought&#8221; here, I am wondering (sorry if this has been answered already and I missed it) but, how can you bypass services like Pool, Snapnames, Enom, etc? </p>
<p>If you want to just buy a name outright is that possible? Or, do these services have exclusives with Domain Registars? How did they (Snap, Pool, Enom) get those contracts in the first place? Is there anyway to bypass the auction services? Can you go to ICANN? Anyone, Anyone, Bueller, Bueller, Bueller? (LOL!)</p>

			<p>Very important question here: </p>
<p>At what point does Google strip the domain of it&#8217;s PR &#038; it&#8217;s age?  Everyone that knows search marketing knows that the age of a domain is VERY important in Google&#8217;s eyes.  Does an expired domain start off as a new index in Google or does the domain keep it&#8217;s age?   </p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any informed responses,</p>

			<p>Thanks for this article. It was interesting watching the status of an expired domain name that I wanted change just as you said. In fact, not taking your advice, I decided to risk registering the name on its scheduled drop date which SHOULD have been October 22. But for some reason on the 22nd, I checked the availablilty and it said that the domain had been registered on October 21, a day before it should have been available. Browsing to the site, there was nothing on it but an auction of the name with an opening bid set at $50.</p>
<p>For unknown reasons, when I went there today to check on the auction, the browser could not find the site. I immediately went to GoDaddy and the name was avaialble (oddly enough), though underlying Whois data listed the expiration date as October 21, 2006. I ended up with the .com and .net variants for</p>

			<p>Thanks for the article.  We did this with snapnames for $60 and I was surprised how fast our process seemed to take.  I might have caught at the end of the 75 day cycle.   Anyway, we were forced to go with Register.com, which is not my first choice for domain registration.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone has any great methods to search for expired domains online that doesn&#8217;t require a software download?</p>

			<p>Dropwatch.com offers databases of expiring domains, searchable and sortable by specific keywords and criterias. It is my service, but was created for me to use daily. So to be fair, checkout StartName.com for a list of simialar services.</p>

			<p>Hi Mike -</p>
<p>First off, thanks for the extremely informative article on catching expiring domains &#8212; and kudos on your getting the #1 spot on google when I searched for &#8216;expired domains&#8217; (but without the quotation marks) &#8211; quite an accomplishment!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a domain addict since 1999 and own some 500+ domain names, most of which are now parked with either Fabulous.com or Sedo.com (although Fabulous usually performs better for me).  I used to grab deleted domains that had good link pop and Page Rank and put up affiliate sites, but my experience has been that for at least the past year or so Google no longer likes deleted domains that have been registered by other parties and the PR is not retained &#8212; so buying an expired domain with the hopes of retaining great ranking in the SERPs no longer works (bummer &#8211; and is why I&#8217;ve resorted to parking many of my domains).  It&#8217;s interesting because once you get started in the domain game, it truly is addicting and while I haven&#8217;t felt the cravings in quite some time, as you can tell by my having landed at your site the urge is back.  You&#8217;ve provided some incredibly informative information with regards to the companies one can use to snag a domain before it drops &#8212; as well as confirmed my suspicions that it is somewhat of a shady business and that it sucks not knowing if just by backordering a domain you now are in competition with some subsidiary of the registrar itself.  That backordering a domain raises a flag letting people know which expiring domains might be valuable.  Pool&#8217;s system, while it appears to work for many, does sound quite sketchy &#8212; I too question whether there truly was a &#8216;real&#8217; person competing with you for newsvine.com, or whether Pool was just trying to bleed some more money out of you.  Sadly, unless lawyers get involved, none of us will ever know.</p>
<p>I actually have a blog called <a>How to Blog</a> in which I&#8217;ve been documenting my own experiences with learning how to blog and providing tips, tricks, theme resources, etc to others interested in getting blogging.</p>
<p>I must say that I&#8217;m extremely impressed by your blog&#8217;s presentation/theme and am wondering if you would divulge both what blogging platform is powering your blog (I&#8217;m going to guess WordPress &#8211; am I right?), and whether you would consider making your themes from this site available to the general public (either for free, or for a fee).  It is an incredibly professional and user friendly layout, and I particularly am blown away by the impressive commenting system which not only numbers each comment, but distinguishes your responses from those written by site visitors &#8211; as well as your &#8216;editors notes&#8217; within the body of individual comments &#8212; is that as simple as editing the comment itself and adding your italicized text?  Your live Comment Preview&#8217;s are also impressive.  I&#8217;d be extremely grateful if you could divulge not only what blogging platform you&#8217;re using (WordPress, MovableType, a proprietary system, etc) and if it&#8217;s WP or MT, what plugins you&#8217;ve got going, as well.  Of course, I would totally understand if you wanted to keep that information to yourself :)</p>
<p>BTW &#8211; with the incredibly amount of PR your site has, as well as high readership and amazing SEO, you really ought to consider putting some adsense ads on your site (in some non-obtrusive way) so that you can generate some income off of the extremely informative and well written articles you&#8217;ve so generously shared with the rest of the net.</p>
<p>Congrats on your new site and on having snatched the domain you wanted succesfully and for such a low price.  The domains I&#8217;ve sold have always been for at least 4 or 5 figures, so $369 is really a steal as you clearly already know.  Argh, now you&#8217;re going to get me back into my domain speculation mode &#8212; so my sleeping domain addiction is waking back up, for better or for worse.  Either way, it&#8217;s always fun and sometimes quite profitable.</p>
<p>Sorry for all of the rambling.  In summary, FANTASTIC post, and excellent blog presentation.  Kudos, and here&#8217;s hoping you&#8217;ll divulge what some of your blogging tools are :)</p>

			<p>Hi Mike, Oct 3rd I posted a few lines about me backordering a couple of medium PR sites with Snapnames&#8230;</p>
<p>I got one of them: http:www.umts-mi.com</p>
<p>It was PR5 before the last PR update, it&#8217;s now PR4 (still good).</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for the great article &#8212; it helped me to understand the entire domain backordering process.</p>

This is usefull if you are looking for generic keyword domains, but if you are looking for targetted traffic names, it is usually better to get the list of domains with stats from a list provider.</p>

			<p>A note on the honesty of registrars&#8230;Back when there was only 1 (Network Solutions) I started receiving calls from the president of a large corporation insisting I sell a domain. When asked what he thought it was worth, he replied &#8220;not much&#8221;. That, I thought, ended the discussion, until I discovered that my domain was locked by the registrar without notice to me, based on the false accusation by the would-be buyer of trademark violation. My site became non-functional, the threats started coming from the corporation&#8217;s heavy duty law firm, and the litigation ball started rolling. I was small but I was right. I fought back. They lost. I&#8217;ve still got the domain. Network Solutions won my undying contempt. Cheers.</p>

<p>Belated thanks for a great article. And the issue is back on the front pages again too &#8212; don&#8217;t miss the Kieran McCarthy article in the Register about how the millionaire owner of Pool.com is behind the new CFIT group that is suing ICANN:</p>

<p>I emailed Kieran that he should read your post for a full understanding of the expiration/registration process.</p>

			<p>You mentioned that snapnames is new to the game, giving them a newbie still allot to learn image. But isnt it the fact that they are already the LEADERS in the domain grabbing insudtry? doesnt a simple google search tell you that? Why is everyone ignoring this fact?</p>

			<p>Snapnames is one of the oldest dropcatchers not a newbie. 3+ years ago snapnames caught 65% of all quality dropping domains, namewinner caught maybe 20%, and a few of the big players like buydomains, ult search, and name admin caught 10% collectively with the rest being caught by smaller dropcatchers and individuals with desktop scripts.</p>
<p>Pool arrived on the scene, enom club drop made a big change, snapnames switched to an auction model etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Snapnames has been around a long time.<br />
An article on my blog actually explains the changes of the drop game in the last few years.</p>

			<p>Awesome article! Easy read and chock full of info.</p>
<p>I do have one question I&#8217;m hoping someone can answer. A domain I am interested is set to expire. If I backorder the domain name through it&#8217;s current registrar do I have a greater chance of securing the domain name (if it&#8217;s not renewed) as opposed to going through someone like pool.com or snapnames.com?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

			<p>If the registrar participates in an exclusive partnership with one of these dropcatchers, the only way to aquire the domain is to backorder it with the partner service. If not, then you should backorder it with each service, pool, snapnames, enom and namewinner are pay for performance, so it will only cost you if you are successful at the one service that aquires the name for you or for auction. </p>
<p>If you are not sure if the current registrar is partnered with any of these services, then I suggest emailing them an inquiry. Do not mention the specific domain name, just ask if they are partnered with one of these dropcatching services, or if they conduct their own exclusive drop auctions.</p>

			<p>I live in the UK and used a domain name watcher service at 123-reg.co.uk it watches names for a year for a cost of Â£16.00 and I have managed to get two associated names for my hair salon. Okay they are not names that everyone is going to want, acourt.co.uk and haircut.uk.com but I was pleased with the service.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting read and I have bookmarked it for reference, well written and advertisement free !!</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

			<p>Thanks, It is very good story but I am very interested to find out about the legal process regarding expiration of domain. I have some problems with my service provider regarding to renewal of my domain. My domain has expired day before yesterday but my service provider refuse to renew it without expiration charge  So how could I get proper legal advise and information? How could I get ICANN legal support?<br />
I hope to hear from you .</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

			<p>Superb article &#8211; read almost like a Tom Clancy scenario! I&#8217;d been planning grabbing a domain or two but had no idea it was such a complex process.</p>
<p>Reminds me of a time I got an offer for a domain name and got it appraised on request. It was only $30 but I had the &#8216;sneaking suspicion&#8217; you mention, that it was the work of an over-zealous appraisal company, more so when I never again heard from the original offerer.</p>

			<p>Too late for me reading this. The 2004 free INFO domains madness took me to register lots of names, among them one associated to my main dot.com that obviously I was planning to renew but when the renewal was near I was unable to use my credit card or bank transfer to complete the operation and domaindiscount24.com does not accept paypal.</p>
<p>Being so close the expiration date I was unable to transfer such domain and other of value to another registrar, I decided to mark them as &#8220;to be deleted immediately&#8221; because domaindiscount24 offers that possibility among the options to renew, delete the domain before the renew or do it as soon as it expires&#8230; theorically. </p>
<p>And the agony started; I knew about the period of grace but those domains should not go through that stage if the non relevant names marked for immediate deletion were deleted effectively&#8230; it started to smell a rat.</p>
<p>And I followed all those days mentioned here doing daily whois checkups with the hope to get back the domains but this time registering them elsewhere. Since the backorders don&#8217;t offer guarantees I thought it was a waste of time and money. </p>
<p>The deletion time arrived but still ignoring the duration of the whole process until I found a service where my domains were offering as backorders for nothing but paying $60 each one if they got it. Still don&#8217;t trusting on the effectiveness of such services I didn&#8217;t take that chance but they posted exact deletion date along with the domain names.</p>
<p>Afilias, the INFO registry, is located in Ireland so my belief was the domain will be deleted at GMT starting that day and I was ready to grab it from my EST location&#8230; midnight in Ireland and the domain was up&#8230; midnight in the East Coast and the morning broken overseas and the domain up&#8230;. 6 in the morning EST and nothing, the domain was not deleted.</p>
<p>Now I can see why, 11 to 14 hours Pacific Time, just when I was not online. The afternoon of the deletion day came with sedo.com selling all my top info domains. Domaindiscount24 is associated with sedo.com but I believe they must drop the domains since  I marked them to be deleted, not to be reserved for their affiliated company. </p>
<p>And now wondering if sedo will keep my domain for the centuries of the centuries, amen&#8230; as I have seen many sedo domains for sale for long long years and still there, on sale, but for granted I will not pay what they pretend to get :/</p>

			<p>FIRST:  I had many domains parked at sedo waiting development.  After moving to own server for development&#8230;. ALL counts on ALL domains increased dramatically.  Hmmmm.??</p>
<p>SECOND:  I wrote mos. ago about godaddy. allowing me to &#8220;backorder&#8221; a domain that I hopped over to another registrar and registered for $7.95 within about 1 minute.  (godaddy wanted backorder charges).  Someone on this blog responded that I was &#8220;suppose to click on the bottom of godaddy page to order domain&#8221;, but that wasn&#8217;t the case.  They wanted to charge more money.</p>
<p>THIRD:  Today on pool.com I looked at list I created of domains to place on backorder.  They didn&#8217;t snag one.  AND they have 2 listed as dropping still &#8230;.yet I found them to already be registered.  1 in the cayman islands in one in country code &#8220;.at&#8221; (not sure where this is).</p>
<p>Quite frankly it just doesn&#8217;t seem like a good business policy to not let your customers &#8220;see&#8221; the bidding process. </p>
<p>There seems to be alot of hanky panky going on.</p>

			<p>so, when you buy an expiring domain, and now transfer it to your domain registrar, in the new whois, does it have today as the created on date, or does it keep the original date that the domain was created on?</p>

			<p>Ryan &#8211; the only time a domain name&#8217;s creation date changes is if it gets deleted and becomes available for re-registration. Acquiring an expired name before it&#8217;s deleted will only extend it from where it left off.</p>
<p>Mike D (the editor) &#8211; a well-thought and well-written article, made better by other players in the industry. Thanks!</p>

			<p>Interesting domain event taking place on &#8220;snap&#8221;.  I backorderd &#8211; They got the domain &#8211; Went to auction &#8211; Active Bidding &#8211; I won!  Yea!  I received the customary email &#8220;you&#8217;re the successful bidder blah blah -<br />
&#8220;Fiducia is the registrar for your new domain name and they will contact you within 24 hours.&#8221;  No contact from Fiducia&#8230;&#8230;so far.  This took place on New Years Eve at 3pm est.  I went to Fiducia (via the net&#8230;not in person of course haha).  I typed in the domain and it &#8220;isn&#8217;t in their database&#8221;.  So I notified Snap of the situation.  (keep in mind it&#8217;s now been 5 days).  The domain doesn&#8217;t show up in whois, yet it&#8217;s clearly going to a parking page.  Snap says they are &#8220;researching&#8221;&#8230;.. I notified them again today &#8211; I haven&#8217;t heard anything.  (other than Snap IS researching)  so far&#8230;.I&#8217;ve paid a few hundred bucks for a domain that someone else has parked!  What&#8217;s up with that!?</p>

			<p>Has anyone ever been successful getting any whois information on pool.com?  It doesn&#8217;t specifically say &#8220;private registration&#8221;&#8230;..any, AND everything but.  </p>
<p>Both times I backordered GOOD names with them, they were registered offshore &#8211; privately.  Funny how pool doesn&#8217;t provide their whois.  Now that&#8217;s FISHY.  I won&#8217;t use them again since discovering this.  </p>
<p>8 days since I won auction on backordered domain and it still isn&#8217;t at the registrar that snap assigned it to.  And it still doesn&#8217;t show up in whois!  I paid for something someone else is parking.  Did get a phone call from Snap and they are &#8220;looking into it&#8221;.   They state &#8220;This isn&#8217;t the 1st time this has happened.&#8221;   Btw, I have backordered successfully on snap before, but this is a &#8220;better&#8221; domain than the previous backorders I&#8217;ve done with them.</p>

			<p>I just lost a site to Enom.com &#8211; <a href="http://www.aecperformance.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aecperformance.com</a> and learned another trick they&#8217;re doing.<br />
The day after it expired afternic.com &#8216;OWNED&#8217; it. Not 75 days later, not 35 days later, THE NEXT DAY, a SUNDAY!!<br />
I got no warnings of any kind that the site was going to expire.<br />
I could bid on it for a minimum of $200.00 if I wanted it back.</p>
<p>I was more than mildly aggravated.<br />
After some heated emails and some heat through my network engineer (who I had bought the site through enom.com under)<br />
They let me renew it for $10.00.</p>
<p>From what I can see, they tried to FOOL me into believing that I had lost the site and would have to pay $200.00+ to get it back.</p>
<p>All&#8217;s well now and I learned another new scam.</p>

			<p>We started up a new business and the domain name we wanted was registered by someone but not used. I found out that the company that had originally purchased this .co.uk name had been bought out by a US company, which subsequently sold that part of the business to a company in New Zealand. I wrote to the person that originally registered the domain name to see if he held the name, or whether it was sold as part of the company and he told me that it was now owned by the company in New Zealand. I wrote to them and asked them if I could have it and  how much it would cost as they didn&#8217;t use it&#8230;.and guess what&#8230;. they agreed to let me have  for nothing, all I had to do was to pay the costs to transfer it to us.</p>
<p>I feel we&#8217;ve now got a great domain name for next to nothing. I know we&#8217;ve been very fortunate and were probably dealing with a company that was not aware of the value of a domain name, but if you don&#8217;t chance your arm, you never know.</p>

I wish I read this before I started the process.  I did it with godaddy.com, but it was deleted from the database in the early morning today, I have had it backordered for 4 months.  What a waste of my time.  Glad you got the domain, I hate to wait.  HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL !</p>

			<p>Mike,</p>
<p>Great article.<br />
Just read trough the comments, couldn&#8217;t wait till you revealed the domain you got.</p>
<p>NewsVine.com ? I visited the site but didn&#8217;t get any onfo what it&#8217;s about or anything.</p>
<p>Can you give us a brief description of the site? Or is that still a secret?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>P.S. Good job on the SEO on this article. You should write something up on SEO too. I&#8217;d like to find out  how your article became so popular.</p>
<p>Valik.</p>

			<p>This is a stupid and misinformed article.  Most of the information presented here is FALSE and i suggest everyone take it with a pinch of salt.  This guy has no idea what he&#8217;s doing, but i have to say he has quite an imagination, at some points it was interesting but the details are a joke.</p>
<p>I also like how he intentionally keeps his &#8220;domain&#8221; a secret to keep the reader&#8217;s interests, and make himself sound mysterious at the same time.  Sounds like a Slate reject writer to me.</p>

I read a great deal about search engine exposure and popularity links, but is there a service that shows the actual number of visitors an expiring site gets?</p>

			<p>4 Questions I might have missed the answers somewhere in here or else where on the net but Maybe someone could help. </p>
<p>1.  Is there any way to see what names are about to expire? By keyword? Without doing a who is on 1000 names.  For example Lets say I want a name with the word &#8220;Book&#8221; in it. Is there a search engine that will show me all the domains with the word book in it that are coming up for renewal in number of months/days   Or any sites that are in the 75 day period?</p>
<p>2.  Pertaining to the keyword search above is there any sites that show you when a site expired I know at <a href="http://www.whois.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.whois.net</a> you can search by keyword. Showing sites that have expired and are back on the &#8220;Open&#8221; Market.  But they are listed alphabetically where as i would be curious to see them listed by experaition date.  Reason for this If a site has been expired and on the &#8220;open&#8221; market for 2 years good chance it means people don&#8217;t think that name would be a good choice for a business. But if a site has just come available and no one else has caught it id be more incline to purchase it.</p>
<p>3. Is there somewhere to search through all the daily transfered/Deleted and registered names by keyword ?</p>
<p>4. Is there anyway to find out how many domains one person/company own?  And names of those other domains.<br />
Thus knowing if your dealing with a professional shark or someone who just beat you to the domain and has it parked for later personal/business use.</p>
<p>PS Good question John Hicks Id love to know the same but i think thats ussally internal information if im correct. But i could be wrong.</p>

			<p>Great article.<br />
I secured a domain using enom and I paid $500 for it. I thought that enom had me bidding against myself, since the domain is in a niche market. Still, I was happy to pay that amount, so I can&#8217;t complain.<br />
I have another coming up in 5 days and I have accounts at snapnames, enom and pool.<br />
I&#8217;m pointing my clients at this page, since I think it&#8217;s the clearest resource I&#8217;ve found for explaining the drop process.<br />
Thanks!<br />
Rich.</p>

			<p>I have used both Snapnames and Pool. Snapnames areat least transparent and their auction model is fair. Pool I strongly suspect are bidding on domains themselves. I queried them about a particular domain I lost out on and got  fobbed off without a clear reply.</p>
<p>I know this particular domain gets alot of traffic. The domain still sits on the Pool holding page getting lots of juicy revenue from the Yahoo partner links.</p>
<p>Their auction process is so murky, the people their are shady. Boy will I laugh when they eventually get seriously investigated or hit with a class action suit.</p>

			<p>Chris &#8211; Yup.  I tend to agree about pool.<br />
 This is what u get when u do a whois on pool.com<br />
(it&#8217;s all bull&#8230;)  Bidding blindly with a co. that provides this info. on their whois seems really crazy to me. </p>
<p>We are unable to process your request at this time.  The whois information is  unavailable for this domain for one of the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Too many simulataneous connections from your host;<br />
(2) The domain you requested is not with this Registrar;<br />
(3) You have exceeded your query limit;<br />
(4) Your IP address has been restricted;<br />
(5) Whois data is not available for this domain &#8211; check back in 48 hours when our server is updated;<br />
(6) Access has been restricted to ensure operational stability;<br />
(7) A system error has occurred;<br />
(8) The time limit for your request has expired;<br />
(9) The IP address provided is not valid or the host specified by the IP address does not exist;<br />
(10) There is an error in what you have inputed or requested;<br />
(11) An unknown error has occurred;<br />
(12) The domain is not currently registered;<br />
(13) The domain you requested contains invalid characters;<br />
(14) The domain you requested is too long;<br />
(15) The domain you requested begins or ends with a dash;<br />
(16) The domain you requested is a third or fourth level domain;<br />
(17) You did not specify a domain name.</p>
<p>Also, I Finally got the domain that I won on auction that got &#8220;lost&#8221; and had a &#8220;snafoo&#8221; from snap!   They Did return my phone calls and Did follow up.  They said they&#8217;ve had the problem in the past but only rarely.   Whatever the &#8220;problem&#8221; was they corrected it.  Thank you Snap!  Fiducia is the registrar (which is the only downfall when using snap) that you don&#8217;t get to pick the registrar where the name will be.  (and it hasn&#8217;t been easy transferring to my existing registrar from Fiducia).</p>

			<p>This is indeed a very informative article.</p>
<p>I found this article by google, when searching for information of this sort, because earlier today i found an expired domain with a pr of 7.</p>
<p>I found this domain, when i pressed a link, and it said that the domain was epired, so i just checked the backlinks, and Wooha! I gotta have that one.</p>
<p>So i backordered it at snapnames, and hopefully i get it</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s a number of companies out there that specialize in delivering lists of domains that are expiring such as <a href="www.sedo.com" rel="nofollow">Sedo.com</a> or <a href="www.redhotdomainnames.com" rel="nofollow">Red Hot Domain Names</a> and I&#8217;m sure many others.</p>
<p>However, if you do a bit of research it&#8217;s obvious that the PR snatching techniques are more and more becoming obsolete since google, and probably the other major search engines, have become aware of them. When google catches note of someone trying to use pre-existing popularity for their website it automatically resets the page-ranks for that website and there&#8217;s a pretty good chance the domain will make it into the &#8220;black-list&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This may be a dumb question &#8230;</p>
<p>Is their a domain expired free service that let&#8217;s you check the rankings, googlepr, yahoo, msn etc. that is free.  I have found a few sites that charge $35-$50 like expiredtraffic.com.  However, I don&#8217;t want to pay a steep $50 per month for something that may be free.  Anyone have any feedback on this?</p>

			<p>Currently only Godaddy/WildWest Domains/Blue Razor but their success ratio is far lower, and rightfully so, because they are competing with 3 registry connections, against companies like pool, snapnames, and enom, that use 30-50 connections each.</p>
<p>That being said, I have in the past used backorders from Domainut.com to catch a one word generic domain Native.com and quite a few hundred traffic domains that earn a few thousand bucks a month for me now.</p>
<p>If you are looking for guaranteed results, backorder at all services, but if your praying for a hail mary, grab a backorder at Domainut.com and cross your fingers (if the first backorder fails, you can always try for other domains with the same backorder for up to one year or until you get a domain with it)</p>

			<p>Expired Domains,<br />
Thanks for your response. It was my understanding that since Godaddy introduced their TDNAM auctions, backordering from godaddy is a waste of time since all of the &#8220;valuable&#8221; domains will be auctioned off anyway.</p>
<p>I see that domainut.com is a part of the DomainAlert Pro backordering system. Is DomainAlert Pro an exclusive backorderer for any registrars or do they just snatch domains after the drop? </p>
<p>Are there truly no other exclusive backordering services affiliated with some of the smaller (even really small) registrars that are first-come first served?</p>

			<p>Very interesting.  Please help me out with a couple of questions to see if I understand things correctly.</p>
<p>First, if a domain name I want is already owned by another and is expiring, the likelihood is that I will ONLY be able to acquire the domain name through the use of a backorder service &#8211; I am unlikely to be able to simply wait until the expiry date and try to register it on my onw because most of the registrars have set up partnerships with these &#8220;drop catchers&#8221; and they do not really just become free again at all?</p>
<p>Second, even though a registrar may have a preferred drop catcher partner it may not end up in their hands and I should register my backorder request with all the leading players in the game?</p>
<p>Third, if I use a backorder service I am required to register the domain name, if they catch it for me, with the registrar of THEIR choosing?</p>
<p>Am I correct on all these points?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>You probably can choose your own registar by transferring the domain.</p>
<p>Once you spent the hundreds of dollars required to catch it you shouldnt mind the transfer fee.</p>

			<blockquote><p>I see that domainut.com is a part of the DomainAlert Pro backordering system. Is DomainAlert Pro an exclusive backorderer for any registrars or do they just snatch domains after the drop? </p></blockquote>
<p>A backorder purchased at Domainut.com (a wild west domains reseller, wild west is owned by godaddy), will be a guaranteed ownership of the domain if a domain were registered with wild west, godaddy, or blue razor prior to expiring, and there were no bids placed on tdnam. If the domain was registered with a different registrar that does not have an exclusive drop setup with a dropcatcher, then the backorder at domainut.com would be attempted(but as I mentioned, would be a long shot).</p>
<blockquote><p>Are there truly no other exclusive backordering services affiliated with some of the smaller (even really small) registrars that are first-come first served? </p></blockquote>
<p>There were a few, but to my knowledge all have since partnered with the dropcatchers and rent their lines now, except GD ww and BR.</p>
<blockquote><p>First, if a domain name I want is already owned by another and is expiring, the likelihood is that I will ONLY be able to acquire the domain name through the use of a backorder service &#8211; I am unlikely to be able to simply wait until the expiry date and try to register it on my onw because most of the registrars have set up partnerships with these &#8220;drop catchers&#8221; and they do not really just become free again at all?</p></blockquote>
<p>Manual drop catching has been outdated for some time, the only shot that you may have to manually register a domain, would be if it was a domain in a niche, that nobody would think to chase expired domains, and flew under the radar of domainers. Domains that are usually backoreder are snapped up within tenths of a second of being released.</p>
<blockquote><p>Second, even though a registrar may have a preferred drop catcher partner it may not end up in their hands and I should register my backorder request with all the leading players in the game?</p></blockquote>
<p>Exclusive drops do not follow the normal drop processes, for instance, snapnames has an exclusive deal with network solutions, if a domain expires that is registered with netsol, the domain is added to an exclusive droplist at snapnames. If any interest is shown (at least one backorder is placed) in the domain during the next 30 days (I believe it is 30 days), the domain will definitely be auctioned at snapnames. But if the losing registrar does not have an exclusive agreement with a dropcatcher, then your best bet is to backorder the domain with every possible choice. (if a dropcatcher catches the domain and you did not preorder [backorder] the domain at that dropcatcher, then you cannot participate in the auction.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Third, if I use a backorder service I am required to register the domain name, if they catch it for me, with the registrar of THEIR choosing?</p></blockquote>
<p>Each dropcatcher rents lines (direct connections to the central registry) from multiple registrars, which they use each day to continuously ping the registry at droptime. The drop process follows a prespecified order each day, and most dropcatchers can predict the second that each domain will drop each day. At that time, each dropcatcher makes a query with each of the rented lines for each domain, most valuable domains are caught by beating out another dropcatcher by a tenth of a second. So there is no way to know which registrar will end up registering the domain, for the dropcatcher. Often times you can get stuck with a foreign registrar that does not even have an english website. (my reccomendation is wait 60 days, unlock the domain and transfer to the registrar of your choice.)</p>
<blockquote><p>You probably can choose your own registar by transferring the domain.</p>
<p>Once you spent the hundreds of dollars required to catch it you shouldnt mind the transfer fee.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a mandatory 60 day wait period after registering a domain, before you can transfer it to another registrar. </p>
<blockquote><p>for example Network Solutions, as a the registrar if SnapNames catches it for me and not a discount registrar of my own choosing &#8211; for the first year of registration.</p>
<p>However, as I write this I realize that it doesn&#8217;t matter which registrar is used because I am not paying them directly &#8212; the &#8220;catcher&#8221; will buy the domain name and then transfer the ownership to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your first year of registration is covered in your backorder or auction bid purchase at most backorder services, except enom and tdnam (at which both tack on an additional registration cost to your winning bid).</p>
<p>As mentioned above you should be able to transfer the domain after you have owned it for 60 days once you unlock it.</p>

			<p>Hi Mike, </p>
<p>Thanks for the great article.  I was just wondering, the domain that I am interested in expires Mid-March of this year&#8230; should I contact those three companies now?  Or, should I wait until the redemption period?</p>
<p>Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks again,<br />
Nicole</p>

			<p>this all sounds a bit bogus since Mike won&#8217;t say what the domain was, nor even why he won&#8217;t tell us &#8211; could just be he owns shares in backorder companies and this is his idea of pumping?</p>
<p>You&#8217;all might like this true story &#8211; a few years back, I use some random &#8220;check availability&#8221; web page on a well known registrars web site.  I found a few available domans, but didn&#8217;t decide to register them at that time.  A week later, I changed my mind, and found all of them had been registered!  I suspected foul play, so I &#8220;checked&#8221; a pile of utterly meaningly dumb domains, and sure enough, a few days later &#8211; every single one of them had been registered.</p>
<p>The moral &#8211; **don&#8217;t** check domains using anyones web page &#8211; you&#8217;re telling them what to go any buy themselves!!!</p>

			<p>Newsvine.com is a very brandable name.  Congrats on nabbing it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m my 3 years domaining, I&#8217;ve managed to catch 2 names manually: <a href="http://www.Joy.tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.Joy.tv</a> and <a href="http://www.NYSE.tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.NYSE.tv</a>.  I don&#8217;t even bother trying with .COM names.</p>
<p>The auctioning of dropped domain names is a very bizarre thing.  Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p>A guy will register a name and park it @ AfterNIC or SEDO, with a selling price of $700, for example.  Other domainers and end users are interested in the name, but they don&#8217;t bid on it because they think that they can wait for it to drop, then nab it.</p>
<p>OK, so a year later, the name drops, and then maybe pool.com catches it.  The same domain investors and end users then bid on the name, and eventually the name gets sold for $25,000.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m seeing quite a lot of the above these days.</p>
<p>Great Blog you have here.</p>

			<p>jasmin.com dropped last week and the auction ended yesterday at $310,250.00</p>
<p>I believe this to be the Biggest sale at Snapnames</p>

			<p>Amazing post mike, I&#8217;ve been to your site several time, this time I got here from google searched &#8216;expired domain names&#8217;.  My objective is not a great name, or a brand-name taken, but simply a very high traffic domain name for a particular search.  So what I am doing is, I go to namewinner.com, and search with a keyword, and then select a domain and do a check on alexa.com to see how much traffic is coming in, if it&#8217;s worth it, it&#8217;s worth placing a bid.</p>
<p>I am totally disappointed by search engine placement services on the net, it&#8217;s a waste of time, more waste of a few dollars.  Infact if you blog on a subject, a good deal of people find you, for example I have been getting hits for &#8216;migun beds&#8217; which I blogged about while doing a few designs for the dealer in kuwait.</p>

<p>If you develop the name, and G00gle finds the site, they will most certainly come after the name, and they&#8217;ll have every right to do so, because the name trespasses on the G00gle trademark.  They&#8217;ll tell you that they want to protect their brand, and they&#8217;ll ask you to transfer the name to them.</p>
<p>Best thing to do is either cancel the name, or just ignore it and let it drop.  No one will buy it from you.</p>

			<p>I need your help!  </p>
<p>The name that I would like the register has been re-registered by a  registrar (ukreg).  They have had the domain name for 4 years now, but haven&#8217;t sold it.  I tried sending them my contact information twice, but have yet to hear back from them.</p>
<p>I am very interested in this domain name&#8230; so how do I buy it from them?</p>

			<p>michelle,</p>
<p>The only way to buy it is either from the owner or the registrar.  You could try back-ordering it from anyplace such as Afternic, namewinner&#8230;  Almost all registrars now offer back-ordering.  You have to decide its worth, in time and value.  Maybe you are better off channelling your energy into other aspects of your work.  But if you read this blog post and all of these posts, you are guided.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I know from experience that backordering fails most of the time.  It&#8217;s a complete waste of money.  There are too many players out there using software to snatch up dropped names, some of which barely have any reseller value.  I challenge anyone to post a comment here who has used a domain registrar (e.g. GoDaddy) backordering service and won your desired domain name.</p>
<p>If you really want a name, best thing to do is follow the advice that&#8217;s  offered by Mike Davidson at the top of this page: use the power-snatchers&#8211;and be prepared to pay a premium.</p>

<p>I do have a follow up question.  Since this is a domain registration company that owns it, shouldn&#8217;t i just be able to buy it directly from them?  I&#8217;ve tried contacting them twice, but they never got back to me.  </p>
<p>This domain is strictly used for bringing people to view the registrars website&#8230; which would seem like they are willing to sell it&#8230;  </p>
<p>So, why would they continue to register the name year after year if they&#8217;re not willing to sell it?</p>

<p>The registrar in question probably wants to keep the name because it brings in valuable type-in traffic to their website (I assume that it&#8217;s a .COM name.)</p>
<p>The registrar holding the name will probably only respond to your messages if a) they believe your offer is serious and b) you are offering a considerable premium for the name, i.e. an offer that would be too tempting to refuse.</p>

<p>Just thought I&#8217;d contribute with a little tip that a lot of Mac users with modems forget: <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/faxing/" rel="nofollow">OS X has fax capabilities built-in</a>.  You can even <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301077" rel="nofollow">fax via Bluetooth</a> if your mobile phone supports it. While faxing is indeed for dinosaurs, it does come in useful every now and again when dealing with antiquated businesses.  No help to the PC owners out there but handy if you&#8217;ve got a Powerbook, as Mike mentions he has.</p>

			<p>All this is very interesting. I was looking to buy up expired domain names in order to get their linkbacks and pr and redirect it. But after reading all this, it seems to me that whichever site that you are trying to get must have a hell of alot of inbound links for it to be worth it. Also it should not be blacklisted in the PR section.</p>

			<p>Congratulations Mike for your nice, interesting and teaching story.</p>
<p>I`m into the domain market as hobby from a few months but I`m into the e-commerce from mid 2000.</p>
<p>I have a few questions for you and/or the experts:</p>
<p>1) ICANN knows the worth of domains but is not doing much to protect registrant`s privacy (they are complaining about the % of .com owners` details being wrong or missing). Furthermore, ICANN is not listening a big honest ( in my modest opinion only ) company as SNAPNAMES who does not hide the post-backorder-auction process like POOL does. If ICANN makes a mistake who is supposed to check the are doing a good job? I`m not an american but I`m not against USA, not at all, since I did cried too on Sept 2001,  BUT : I don`t like that only USA is controlling the WWW. I would much prefer a worldwide organization totally independent , jut similar to the United Nations.</p>
<p>2) if, like I suspect , some registrars buy back-ordered or other valuable domains who is going to check these things that to me are simply e-crimes considering the worth of domain names as digital real estate property?</p>
<p>3) did anyone notice that VeriSign own a website called : <a href="http://www.greatdomains.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatdomains.com</a><br />
If I was in the USA , I was opening the eyes of some autorities&#8230;..just checking you never know but I`m having some bad feelings.</p>
<p>4) Why this so much big industry does not start to be regulated (ALWAYS POINTING TO ICANN HERE) in a way that every CCTLD has same rules? Here we`re assisting that some CCTLD like the canadian .ca are open only to canadian citizens, we can register the word sex in many countries but not in all of them, China is trying to create another sort of ICANN with their own domains&#8230;&#8230;.and many other issues. Still I have to hear that americans complain that they can`t register .EU &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;do they forget that europeans CAN`T register .US ?????<br />
On another side we can, all the world can, register domais in little countries like pacific islands who created their domain registry JUST to join this BIG MONEY MAKING INDUSTRY.<br />
And registrars are HAPPY. VERY HAPPY. More domain extensions ? NO THANKS !<br />
Otherwise, too much means less value. Think about it.<br />
Thanks in advance for your answers.</p>

Some registrars sneakily register domain names in their own name, we don&#8217;t. Your domain is yours to keep and do with as you wish.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>All of this should move some kind of FBI or is it just my crazy idea that some players in the domain industry are commiting crimes?</p>

			<p>Great article. I once had a domain stolen from me by a shady registrar. I bought the .info domain from him for about $300 and then he did not give me full access or I was too new that I did not know how to change my password. He billed me wrong for rerenewing and when I requested a credit for 1 year, he cancelled the whole payment and the domain retroactively expired.</p>
<p>Do you know of a way to try and bid on a domain before it expires?</p>

One-word popular English domains are hard to find at  a bargain these days.</p>

			<p>Mike,</p>
<p>I have a request/suggestion for your Blog and the comments.  Because there were SO many comments, I got tired of reading them and only wanted to find the new posts/comments from you.  I thought of searching for &#8220;Mike Writes&#8221;.  Unfortunately, your comments uses &#8220;Mike Writes&#8221; as an image which can&#8217;t be searched for.  </p>
<p>Can you do something to make it easier to find your comments or additions?</p>

			<p>Here is really great. people are writing to this blog since last year.<br />
About my domain problem, Ä± was searching through google and find this blog easily. My little question is, I have been after a domain for more than 5 years. The registrar is always a domain/hosting company who creates a record for a year and then I wait for 70 days. Before the end of 75 days I do not know how but another domain company updates the record for another year. This keeps happening every year. This year I was expecting to receive it but I saw that 10 days ago, another company (directnic) updated the record for another year.Would it helped if I had back ordered? Do I have to bid to the domain company ? What else I can do? Because these guys make me follow them each year and do not let go the domain I want.<br />
Thanks for any comments and experiences.</p>

@Sunny &#8211; Sedo is not a registrar!  They offer a domain marketplace, parking program, escrow service as well as domain appraisals, a brokerage service and the option to sell websites.<br />

			<p>Are you aware that pool.com offers it&#8217;s &#8220;snatching-service&#8221; for newly registered .EU Domains as well ?</p>
<p>They say they will try to register the domain name for you on April 7 (day, the landrush period starts) before any other provider. If you are the only one wanting to have the domain name you&#8217;ll get it for 60 Euro, if there are others, bidding starts.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea about the possible success with acquiring domain names ? Because if I pre-register with any other domainprovider, they just charge 20 euros or so.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

			<p>I saw this situation from another side. I lost one domain due to expiration. That was an old project that run on autopilot. Domain was prepaid for few year and actually that was no one who monotored expiraion date for this domain. And once when I visited that site I found completely different site. Checking whois data show me that now that domain belongs to someone else. Thanks Mike for this article!!</p>

			<p>Domaining/Parking Domins is a multimillion dollar buisness<br />
There is no rules and a lot of gray areas<br />
If you are going after a quality name that either has inherent value or traffic the &#8220;Big Fish&#8221; will eat your lunch  they have money coming out of the Wazoo (and virtually no expenses) .<br />
pool.com and snapnames.com are it but play even with the other mediocre snatchers. (They might pull a fluke)<br />
Everybody is in it for the money including some of the posters (registrar&#8217; employees) and some others using affiliate links.<br />
No I didn&#8217;t save a bunch of money by switching to GEICO neither I stayed at the Holiday Inn.</p>

			<p>Jack, this is one business where everything and anything goes. One BO service will outdo the other one moment, the other will outdo the first the next.</p>
<p>Snapnames seems to be doing better these past few months. But that could change soon if Pool especially discovers something SN doesn&#8217;t, especially with at least one expert on their side. ;)</p>

			<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>You said that you for a time though about beating goDaddy and trying to snatch the domain manually. Could you give a brief despription of how does one do that. I would eventually employ a drop catcher to have the domain name that I want, just to be safe. But however I would like to know the manual method also for information sake. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ash</p>

			<p>Amber Baker:<br />
As I understand article, situation with &#8220;what will happen the day after&#8221; is not documented with official rules except one of last registrator of your domain. Yes, most of registrators with good reputation follows this rules and give opportunity to keep domain even after expiration date. But may be your domain was registered with not so fair registrator who sold your domain to one of his client as soon as domain became expired&#8230; May be the firs step you should make is contact with your domain registrator?</p>

			<p>I was able to squak enough to get my domain back. Maybe they didn&#8217;t sell it, but allowed someone to park their page there&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, but I don&#8217;t care as long as I still own my business name.</p>
<p>Thanks guys for all the great info and comments!</p>
<p>Good luck sniping!</p>

			<p>Mike</p>
<p>Really enjoyed your story. Thanks. Have backordered with goDaddy. Suppose it&#8217;s a waste of money if my chances are rather slim.</p>
<p>Does anybody know the best place to list domain names that one wishes to sell? I want to sell some of my names to help pay for my wedding! names like &#8211; oneclickstart.com, freeyourdreams.com, creditgrab.com, britishairmiles.com, gogglegirl.com, chinafreedom.info, hundred.in amongst others.</p>
<p>Any feedback would be appreciated!</p>

<p>@The V: Well you can put you domains up for sale on TDNA (another godaddy.com service) or i am sure you could sell your domain on pool.com too ?</p>

<p>when is your wedding? Don&#8217;t expect to sell it fast. I recommend to list it on sedo.com and/or afternic.com.</p>

			<p>I just came across this post while searching for info on how to gain traffic from expired domains simply because it was suggested on WarriorForrum that John Reese bought alot of domain names in bulk to get his many adsense sites going in under 120 days which produced a little over 500k.</p>
<p>Although,I realize I can buy one domain and have sub-domains underneath.</p>
<p>But my question is: will I have to wait 40-75 days for any expired domain I want? This is not efficient&#8230;is there another alternative&#8230;what about expired domains that are truly expired instead of being about-to-be expired?</p>

			<p>What a dirty business this domain &#8220;snatching&#8221; is.</p>
<p>I read your domain expiry proceedure with interest and subsequently I found that a site I was interested in aquiring had recently expired.</p>
<p>Great I thought &#8211; lets go get an interest in a backorder registered.<br />
It had expired March 11th 2006, it was April 16th &#8211; getting late but still time I thought (Mike gave that 40+30+5 day timespan)</p>
<p>But no, the domain was in &#8220;closed&#8221; auction &#8211; tough luck I was told.<br />
What tee&#8217;s me off is that Networksolutions &#8211; have registered the expired domain in their name and are basically calling the shots to their own time table.<br />
So a word of warning to readers, perhap. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any specific time span proceedure followed by some registrars. And they will grab domains of interest for their own controlled sales exploitation.</p>

			<p>Just a comment on the &#8220;dirty business&#8221; of domain snatching message I posted earlier.</p>
<p>After some communications with involved parties it was made clear to me that NetworkSolutions operate a &#8220;Transfer Fulfillment policy&#8221; where they can auction a site off only 35 days after expiry. Domains that interest them will then be exclusively offered to snapnames for resale.</p>
<p>The domain owner relinquishes all rights to the domain after that 35 day period. There is no follow on Redemption period.</p>
<p>So if you host with NetworkSolutions beware.<br />
And Mikes 75 day timespan is not &#8220;standard&#8221; in fact the registrars can play it out pretty much as they please.</p>

			<p>This must be the definitive page on this topic, right. I found it as the first result on my google query for EXPIRING DOMAINS. Congrats on this great post and the follow up comments.</p>
<p>My learning from all this is that I am going to stick to GoDaddy Backorder, which means I will get an expiring domain name only if no one else wants it. :-(</p>
<p>Hey cool live comment preview too. Just noticed it.</p>

			<p>Thanks for the heads up on this fascinating world of expired domains. Before perusing this blog I was thinking of grabbing a min of 100 domains, thought it would be a no brainer, obviously I was wrong! Nice while the thought lasted, for it&#8217;s now back to buying 50K of redirected traffic a month @ $400 bucks a pop.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

			<p>Great article. I was sitting here wondering about how to grab a domain for my step-father. He has a construction business. We have the .net and .org, but not the .com. It expires at midnight tonight, or so I thought. Now I know I don&#8217;t have to stay up all night waiting for it to kick the bucket.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

			<p>Ok, but what&#8217;s the domain name?!<br />
J/K&#8230;  :-P</p>
<p>Seriously, I read all 372 comments, and by now, the words &#8216;news&#8217; and &#8216;vine&#8217; have lost all meaning.  I&#8217;ve read them so many times I don&#8217;t even recognize them as English anymore.  Frightening&#8230;</p>

			<p>Wow! it is very rare to have both an interesting article and a HUGE amount of replies that are extremely enlightening</p>
<p>I am interested in this one .com which is Deleted/On hold whatever with an australian registrar but am not willing to pay more than 50 bucks for it (it is for a non-commercial site). I was shocked to find that it had expired in the first place considering who its previous owner was. Not that they used it but i understood why they owned it.</p>
<p>I was notified of the sale through a spam mail offering me to buy it for a large amount by <a href="http://www.webnamesolution.com/," rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://www.webnamesolution.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.webnamesolution.com/</a>, who are appearantly a very dodgy pseudo-dropshark that are merely out to scam. At least that is what the google search brought up with more than one link! Posted this bit just to inform people, i did not do business with them.</p>
<p>This blog entry proved highly informative and made clear that I for one do not plan on using any of the sharks and pay through the roof. I will just keep my fingers crossed and check alot. After all I already own the .org and that generates enough traffic as it is.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting it, and thanks to virtually all posters for their insightful replies.</p>

			<p>Thats a Strong Article. It helped me a lot and right now i have 3 domains on auctions through snapnames. Wonder why i never thought of it before.. The best part of the article itself is the other Auctioneer whome i never knew like pool for instance. But i think snap names is great. And one more thing&#8230; your DOMAIN IS GREAT !!! i just checked it on alexa&#8230; and BINGO you have a traffic to kill</p>
<p>Frankly you have helped&#8230; if i knew this thingy a year ago i would have been a millionaire today&#8230; Better late than never :))</p>

			<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am still in the 107 post.<br />
But i would like to set-up a service to check domain names, basically offering some kind of service like dropwatch does. I presume i would need a script to check the whois database, then page rank, alexa etc&#8230;<br />
Are there any open source scripts that already provide something similar, or would i have to start from scratch, or, it there any other way to do it?</p>
<p>Thx<br />

			<p>Oh the irony is killing me so I just have to share this. After spending about 3 hours last night reading every single comment on this topic I went to play around with pcnames.com to see what names were already expired and available that I might be able to snap up (just buy, not backorder). Of all the things, I was able to pick up dnsauctions.com :)</p>

			<p>Well I have been waiting for the &#8220;inevitable&#8221; increase in my PR for the last 2 years; and I use the word &#8216;inevitable&#8217; rather quite losely.  </p>
<p>Yes I am doing something wrong and I just can&#8217;t seem to get it right.  In my quest for the &#8216;seo grail&#8217; I landed up content of same nature.  Content dealing with Expired Traffic.  Its also known by different keywords, or rather should I say, Adwords, such as but not limited to Expiring Traffic, Expiring Domains, Deleting Domains, Deleted Domains, Drop Names, etc etc etc.</p>
<p>Of course, in this ever so crowding cybersphere (don&#8217;t bother I already checked it and its taken) I have landed up on this particular content the third time.  Figuring that the power of three might prove to be a charm, I was dismayed as it only works for WB Charmed Girls.</p>
<p>I have read so many articles talking about the same thing when it comes to name drops that I think I could start writing, or at least, parphrasing them name earning some Adsense revenue.  However, what I have started to think is that getting listed in Dmoz or yahoo might still happen; of course I am still not listed there.  I think getting a PR5 expired domain with high link popularity is much harder than the DaVinci code itself.</p>
<p>P.s. If anyone wants to help me then please by all means do contact me; I know wishful thinking! ((smokes his pipes or even dreams away)</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m back. The domain I&#8217;m waiting for is in PENDING DELETE status. I was kind of spooked the other day when I got an email from a site (not pimpin&#8217;em here!) saying that they owned the domain and if I want it, fork over $199! Now, at the moment I don&#8217;t see that anyone *owns* it. I&#8217;m registered with GoDaddy (I can&#8217;t afford the other options) and I&#8221;m wondering how this other site has my name. I also went to those other sites above that list expired domains and it wasn&#8217;t listed there. </p>
<p>So, how did they find me? Any help would be appreciated.</p>

			<p>Hey Mike,<br />
Although I found it a bit late, this is a great article.  One question though:<br />
Now that we all know the domain name, and we know what you were planning while you were trying to acquire the name, what would you have done if you didn&#8217;t get it?  Did you have backup names for Newsvine?  A better question would be&#8230; can a business name really rely that much on domain name availability, or do considerations need to be built into the business plan?  Changing the name of your entire project seems like a BIG consideration.  I&#8217;m just curious to hear your take on this&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

			<p>Your article has convinced me that my lawyer does not have an IT clue about the &#8216;robbery&#8217; of domain names.  I am now better armed to pursue my tag agent for mismanagement.  Nobody could tell me the ICANN process when domain names have gone into suspension.  It happened to me recently.  My .com domain was pinched within 35 days of suspension (my tag agent had not informed me).  I was lucky to be able to re-purchase my .co.uk version. (Nominet are very helpful and told me the full process).<br />
I was able to track down the new owner of my .com domain and have nearly completed the transaction to re-purchase.<br />
This type of &#8216;game&#8217; is really bad news for small traders who are so busy trying to make their business work, they don&#8217;t realise their shop window has just disappeared out of the sky.<br />
Surely with all the clout you have in the US you can get some kind of legislation going on this. Perhaps we could get together as a global force to create change?<br />
I was a bit nervous when the guy I&#8217;m purchasing back the domain from mentioned that he will transfer my details to GoDaddy.  I&#8217;m still nervouse after what I have read here.<br />
Could my domain be grabbed before my purchase is complete?<br />
I am asking for the transfer to be made to my new (honest) tag agent. I assume this should not be a problem?<br />
Thanks once again for your information.</p>

			<p>What this article has reaffirmed to me, is that the DNS is broken.<br />
The middlemen have taken over.</p>
<p>What is needed is a Jesus in the Market place scenario, if that&#8217;s a fair anology.  These domain name prospectors or domain typo folks are leeches.  Why are people making millions off this, talk about the anti-Internet, the DNS is a pox.</p>
<p>An entirely new name resolution mechanism needs to be created to allow for instant access to names (sort of what RFC1918 and NAT have done to limit the IPv4 crunch).  Some sort of P2P DNS, no central authority, now single servers to crash, allow a way for anyone to register any kind of name and still have it be unique.  Oh and be rock solidly secure (right).</p>
<p>Maybe move away from English style tags altogether, or English names coupled with GPS data, something. </p>
<p>Pie in the sky?  Maybe?  But you never know, this is the Internet after all, all bets are off.   Established norms can and will be broken.  VoIP anyone?</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m after a recently expired domain that is owned by Registrar: MELBOURNE IT, LTD. D/B/A INTERNET NAMES WORLDWIDE<br />
Referral </p>
<p>They don&#8217;t have a formal backorder service, just an ambiguous &#8220;show interest&#8221; form for no cost, with details that say they will contact you when/if it becomes available. I&#8217;m a newbie at this, but it SEEMS to me that letting them know I am interested will just prompt them to keep it and just try to charge a high fee to obtain it.</p>
<p>Am I right? Am I better just registering with all the major domain &#8220;catchers&#8221;, and NOT letting them know of my intent.</p>
<p>P.S. For the benefit of me and others, if anyone who replies cares to give us a current/updated list of which/how many services to use to increase the probability of success, sir would be GREATLY appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

			<p>A relative of mine has a small business and her son registered the business name under the .com but never did anything worthwhile with it. </p>
<p>When she hired a lazy web designer to work up the site for real (more of a favor to the person learning to be a webdeveloper than to kickstart the business onto the web), that person couldn&#8217;t figure out how to &#8216;get&#8217; the domain or the ftp access to it so instead registered a new business name under .net and now several web designers later its fallen into my hands to manage the site.</p>
<p>So it occurred to me to grab onto the .com domain and have it point to the other site. Language barriers and procrastination on everyone&#8217;s part left the .com to expire.</p>
<p>So recently I get a wild hair and go to check on it only to find that some entity in hong kong now is the proud owner of &#8216;our&#8217; .com name along with thousands of others: it appears that whomever this is at <a href="http://www.wangleedomains.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wangleedomains.com</a> is a modern-day webpirate who surfs the web looking for wayward expiring domains and pillages them from the ether in hopes of being able to hold the domain a virtual-hostage and ask for outrageous amounts of money to &#8216;sell&#8217; the domain name to prospective buyers. </p>
<p>From netsearching I&#8217;ve discovered that apparently this is like one of those &#8216;work at home&#8217; and make money affairs that everyone gets spammed into their emailboxes. Only, this cat is reallly doing it.</p>
<p>Thinking someone will pay $900 USD for a domain name.</p>
<p>I :-) back at him and told him: sorry, its not worth that much. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Now he wants to bargain/deal with me. hmm. lets see&#8230; this has dragged out for months/years now and i&#8217;m in no hurry to get it so nah, I&#8217;ll procrastinate some more&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks for telling your story. I found it interesting and the blogging responses very entertaining and informative. Good luck with your new (expensive) domain :-)</p>

			<p>I had a similar experience with a certain Wang Lee, based out of Hong Kong. For one reason and another (and another) I&#8217;d let a domain expire that I&#8217;d registered for a friend. It was his main site, where all his email went through, his design portfolio, etc &#8211; it was <a href="http://www.his_name.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.his_name.com</a>. Oops.</p>
<p>Anyway, Wang Lee snatched it, so I emailed him asking if I could have the domain back. The response &#8211; yeah, $900 please (my response &#8211; f*** off, idiot.)</p>
<p>About 2 hours later &#8211; strangest thing, I go to my usual domain registrar, and see if I can bag the .net or .org version as a kind of consolation for my friend, and there is the .com available again&#8230; I bought it.</p>
<p>In your face Wang Lee!</p>

			<p>I would hate to say anything bad about a recommendation made here, BUT&#8230;<br />
SNAP BACK is NOT a good idea.<br />
You will be able to get your domain name, by using THEIR domain parking service, or even their web/domain service.</p>
<p>THE CATCH!!!<br />
I had the opportunity to snag and DID snag a fantastic website name using this service..<br />
The catch came when I tried to transfer the domain to another agent.<br />
1. They have a required parking time you MUST use their servide.<br />
2. When the time is up, they stalled my effort to switch and eventually sole the domain name right from under me.</p>
<p>So ultimately.. I paid them to make $. They blocked my attempts to switch parking services, refused to unlock the block and when my domain expired, it was sold for very big $$ to DELL computers doing a new launch product.<br />
I made formal and unanswered complaints with every governing body of internet domain names..<br />
I tried to find the company and make a complaint IN PERSON.<br />
GUESS WHAT<br />
CAYMAN ISLAND COMPANY  (no real address)<br />
RUN by the same company who TOOK the domain name and sold it.<br />
Also a CAYMAN ISLAND COMPANY (no real address)</p>
<p>For anyone not in the know about &#8216;cayman island business&#8217;<br />
Its the main stomping ground of any fraudulent or big business company that wants to escape legal actions.</p>
<p>I will admit I &#8216;could&#8217; have been smarter and found this out sooner.<br />
But my advice.<br />
DO it the old fashion way.. AND WAIT, or check the expired and available names lists.</p>
<p>This company is a scam.</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Question??  When you say snap back is not a good idea&#8230;&#8230;.was it snapnames.com?</p>
<p>As I have had an awful time transferring from the registrars they have sent domains to that I have acquired.  Big pain in the ass&#8230;..however I have had one transfer (out of a dozen or so).  And I&#8217;ve been wondering if they were legit&#8230;.. I know pool is very hidden as to &#8220;who&#8221; they are.  Would not recommend them to anyone.</p>

			<p>Hi -</p>
<p>  I work for one of those registrars, and although I skipped through a few of the posts in the middle, I did enjoy the article (although some information is slightly incorrect) timeframes on Redemptions and exact timing on when domains become available by the registry.</p>
<p>  I can say this though to the poster from a few posts back. Yes, domain capturing is a growing business. A lot of people and business&#8217;s simply fail to renew there domains and will often times let them slip through the cracks. I personally search expired and auctioned domain names in an attempt to aquire and resell, or if enough traffic is still going through them, set up pay per click links. </p>
<p> I can say that I did manage recently to purchase a 3 letter domain name from someone I found. I purchased it for practically nothing (less then $100). I resold it last month for almost $20,000 &#8211; no joke.</p>
<p> I can tell you this with certainty &#8211; Domains are virtual real estate. Buy now while you can!</p>

			<p>Mike, or anyone out there&#8230;<br />
Can you advise at all.  Confused and dazed, to say the least!<br />
But first, thanks for the stacks of info in here, truely helpful&#8230;</p>
<p>The .com I wish to &#8220;nab&#8221; is sitting at REGISTRAR-LOCK status. Hmmm<br />
Tucows whois search shows a last updated of 6 Apr 06, but the whois search shows a different date of 29 Jun 05 !!  EH !</p>
<p>Also, any idea what this means?<br />
EPP Status: clientUpdateProhibited<br />
EPP Status: clientTransferProhibited<br />
EPP Status: clientDeleteProhibited</p>
<p>I have no idea if this .com domain is about to come free, or what?<br />
It&#8217;s expiry date is Oct 06.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on what my next move is on this one?</p>

			<p>Hi Mike,<br />
First of all thanks a lot on sharing this informations on snatching of expiring domains. They are really helpful and cleared a lot of doubts regarding the process.</p>
<p>However, I have a couple of questions.<br />
1) Is this verisign server, from where these companies snatches the domain names available for public access? Where is this server located?<br />
2) If answer to my first question is yes, then is there even a possiblity to write a code similar to the other snatchers to do the same thing. Do you need to be a domain registrar for  that?</p>
<p>Hope to get an answer on this.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Sukanta</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting on a domain to come available so I&#8217;ve been going to godaddy.com almost daily and searching to see if it was free yet. It finally dropped only to be snatched immediately by wangleedomains.com.</p>
<p>I emailed them and asked how much they wanted for it. The answer? $3900.</p>
<p>I told them to keep it and to choke on it.</p>
<p>This sort of thing isn&#8217;t right.</p>

			<p>Hah. About a month ago, I stumbled in here and found what you wrote to be most informative. I have a few domains, probably about 20, all that have been registered out of the blue, with no prior owners until just recently. I had an idea for a site, and wanted to register the domain in case the idea went through. I jumped over to GoDaddy, my registrar of choice and found that the domain was in fact, already registered, but that it had Expired roughly three weeks before. So, after reading your article, I decided to backorder it through GoDaddy and leave it at that. I know this is the least effective option, but after dealing with GoDaddy, I can say that in my experience, it isn&#8217;t an option. Backordering a ~20 fee for automated checking of a domain every now and then, watching the domain&#8217;s status, I knew when it entered the deletion period and I waited and refreshed GoDaddy the day it &#8220;dropped&#8221; expecting to find the &#8220;last checked&#8221; time updating every minute or so looking for the domain. Anyway, long story short. GoDaddy didn&#8217;t check the domain until 6pm that night after it had already been picked up by snapnames. While I know GoDaddy wouldn&#8217;t have beaten Snapnames, it would have been nice to have seen them make an effort.</p>
<p>I cruised over to snapnames.com and checked the availability of the domain there. I found it available (which I guess means I could have used snapname&#8217;s cheapest service and gotten the domain.) Great I thought&#8230;. I&#8217;ll pick the domain up here and transfer it. Until I saw the price tag. One hundred thousand dollars. Please tell me this was just an automated first price and it will go down?</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post. Just pissed off at GoDaddy.</p>

			<p>Hi<br />
Great Article   , U have The art of Writing In ur blood .<br />
&#8221; This info was very Informative &#8220;</p>
<p>Im also looking forwarding to backorder a domain , Although it&#8217;s not sought after now , Its a five letter and By that time five letters might be scarce , the domain might be in for a large fight and i dont have that much of a resources to  Get it then .<br />
Thats why i think the Verisign was very appealing to me .</p>

			<p>I tried using GoDaddy back order and it was a hopeless..</p>
<p>In the end I managed to get the domain myself just by persistance and continually checking on the day it was due for release..</p>
<p>Therefore I got it where GD failed and I have no back up..</p>
<p>One odd thing I have noticed with expiring domains is, after the expire date they are given a name of someone who has purchased it.. it looks like someone has already bought it, but in fact this is not the case.. in one instance I even contacted the &#8216;so called new owners&#8217; and they knew nothing about it&#8230;</p>
<p>So it seems that there are many sneeky tricks involved in this dirty business&#8230;</p>
<p>I was pleased to get the domain as it was for my own design business, .. still not developed the site lol .. but the big intentions are still there.. PrtScr.com  it&#8217;s perfect as it is advertised on almost everyones keyboard already&#8230; :-)  and I design for Print and Screen<br />
hence the Print and Screen Company &#8230; </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get round to using it sometime soon.. promise &#8230; once I pay the bills and find the time and energy and and &#8230; lol</p>

			<p>About 6-9 months ago google started taking away PR from expired domains that followed the normal drop process. Sometimes you can get lucky and slip through, but most lose it, however it is rather simple to get it back by putting up fresh content if the backlinks to the site are still present.</p>

			<p>Truly a fascinating and entertaining story &#8211; yet also educational.  I&#8217;m currently trying to get a domain that has entered the first expiration phase and deciding whether or not my GoDaddy service is good enough.  I&#8217;ll take a look to see if its a NetSol domain and if so give SnapNames a shot, perhaps.</p>

<p>Settling for the .net version of a domain is not a great choice in my opinion, especially for a client that could spend a lot of money on branding their name. The .net version will always lose traffic to the .com version and hurt the branding of the company especially if the .com is owned by a competitor.</p>

			<p>I agree that the &#8220;.com&#8221; name is by far the best. For a hobby blogger might not make much difference, but for a serious blogger, it is worth the effort to try to get a &#8220;.com&#8221; name. There are several tools that can help when it comes to finding a premium unregistered domain name. I mention a few in my blog (<a href="http://blog-howto.com/archive/2006/09/06/GoodDomainNameForYourBlog.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blog-howto.com/archive/2006/09/06/GoodDomainNameForYourBlog.aspx</a>); for example &#8211; Mozzle has a free tool.</p>

			<p>Interesting that Godaddy backordering did not work for several people.<br />
I feel particularly privileged in this matter.<br />
I had a .com domain name backordered at Godaddy several months ago.<br />
One week after the domain was de-registered I got notified that Godaddy has successfully captured the domain.</p>
<p>In the intervening period it was held by a some other registrar.</p>

			<p>Maybe a distributed computing based technology can be used to beat these few snatchers. i.e. each interested people install a client on the PC and round robinly try to snatch the domain from their PC. If successful, thet get a % fee for it :-)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not do-or-die for me, so I am going to skip the expen$ive services and give it a go DIY.</p>

			<p>Very helpful article!  I used snapnames to pick up a domain and it worked great.  The domain at in expiration for 40 days, and then I picked it up for $65.  Weird thing was, I got an email from a company called Webname Solution the day before offering to sell me the domain for $199.95.  I totally freaked out&#8230;but relaxed after research the company a bit and finding out that this is just a scam they do to you if they know you own related extensions.  Jerks.</p>

			<p>Thanks for the response, interestly none of the attempts i&#8217;ve made via pool.com on TLA&#8217;s have even had the courtesy of a &#8216;you failed&#8217; email. It just sits there while the domain disappears into (I guess) auction.</p>
<p>On a similar vein, I have been trying out godaddy,pool.com and snapnames. One particular &#8216;Gotcha&#8217; with godaddy is that buried in their T&#038;C&#8217;s is they &#8216;can take two weeks to transfer the domain&#8217; and also more worryingly &#8216;during that period the original registrant can exercise right to buy back&#8217; I dont know how the hell that is legal after the deletion occurs. But two weeks is a long time if your buying residual traffic! Interestingly the domain drops IMMEDIATELY into godaddy&#8217;s new adwords for domains parking, which the owner does not see anything from unless they buy into their scheme!</p>
<p>So unless i&#8217;ve got things completely wrong, i&#8217;ve bought a domain which the registrar is not transferring immediately to me, and in the mean time godaddy is profitting from my traffic! seedy world this domain business.</p>

			<p>Very well written article.<br />
I am after a domain name and after checking out the WHOIS info it comes up as follows </p>
<p>Registrar: DOTSTER, INC.<br />
Whois Server: whois.dotster.com<br />
Referral<br />
Name Server: NS4.NAMERESOLVE.COM<br />
Name Server: NS3.NAMERESOLVE.COM<br />
Name Server: NS2.NAMERESOLVE.COM<br />
Name Server: NS1.NAMERESOLVE.COM<br />
Status: PENDINGDELETE</p>
<p>Is there any advantage using SnapNames, Enom or Pool to try and grab the name or is there another client better suited than the big 3 for grabbing the name I am after having seen the WHOIS info above?</p>

			<p>A question on residual traffic. I&#8217;ve had some very poor experiences of buying domain names for residual traffice. Domains listed as having 30,000+ visitors a month on the likes of droppatrol or sedo actually delivering less than 100 uniques per month.</p>
<p>So my question is in two parts: Are there ANY reliable methods of estimating the residual traffic on a domain? DMOZ listing seems often to be inversely propritional to traffic! And if what I have exerienced is true (and I HAVE been aquiring quite easily some of the top daily listings on droppatrol) does that mean that the traffic guys that claim to deliver huge traffic campaigns to your site based on purchasing expired domains, are all, well lying?</p>

			<p>Very helpful!</p>
<p>Do you think some of these sites keep record of how many people &#8220;search&#8221; for a name?  Snapnames.com has an area to enter in a search for the domain.  Wonder if this puts up &#8220;flags&#8221; for them to watch that name?</p>
<p>Also was reading another article on this same subject but they stated other snatching sites.  How did you arrive at your &#8220;three major domain snatching firms&#8221;.  The article I was reading was at <a href="http://www.igoldrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.igoldrush.com</a> and they agreed with your recommendtion of <a href="http://www.snapnames.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapnames.com</a>, but picked <a href="http://www.namewinner" rel="nofollow">http://www.namewinner</a> and <a href="http://www.expirefish.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.expirefish.com</a> as their other two&#8230;..any comment?</p>

			<p>Another question: It would appear that chinese traffic is featuring larger and larger in the domain game, and i&#8217;ve found i&#8217;ve picked up quite a bit of it almost unintentionally. Does anyone on here have any experience of the best parking sites to monetise chinese traffic through? Sedo appears worse than useless for it.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;d like to point out something that is being overlooked, and may or may not be significant. But I need to preface it with how I found out about this little &#8220;twist&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>I recently tried to transfer several domains away from NameSecure. It was a couple of days before expiration, and I had no idea that I was in for a go. NameSecure didn&#8217;t respond to my transfer request, and so, thinking to pre-empt any loss of Domain Names, I decided to go ahead and renew. I was further relieved to read on their web site:</p>
<p>&#8220;We currently endeavor to provide a grace period that extends of 35 days past the expiration date, to allow the renewal of domain name registration services.&#8221;</p>
<p>You could see the smile on my face, right?</p>
<p>WRONG!</p>
<p>And thus the horror began. Their site would not allow me to renew and displayed the message: &#8220;Cannot process with supplied information&#8221;. So, I tried a different credit card. Same thing. I rechecked all inputted data several times. Same response. &#8220;Cannot process with supplied information&#8221;.</p>
<p>During this (Presently week long process) I have been sending daily e-mails with no response whatsoever. A casual search of the internet describes similar stories from many people having dealings with NameSecure.com.</p>
<p>Upon reading further on their web site, I found the following: </p>
<p>&#8220;If an expired domain name registration is not renewed during any grace period provided by us, pursuant to our Service Agreement, rather than delete the domain name registration, we may, in our sole discretion, attempt to find a third party who is interested in registering the domain name&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>But they won&#8217;t do it until AFTER the grace period:</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not attempt to complete a Direct Transfer of a domain name registration after expiration if the customer to whom the domain name is registered notifies us by submitting a service request form that he or she does not want us to proceed with such a transfer. In this case, the domain name registration will be deleted. A customer&#8217;s failure to notify us that they do not want us to complete a Direct Transfer constitutes that customer&#8217;s consent to the Direct Transfer.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is pretty obvious from the service agreement that Namesecure has a vested interest in domain names expiring, and falling outside the grace period.</p>
<p>I wrote a an e-mail and told them not to do the direct transfer, hoping to make them realize there is nothing in it for them. What I am trying to do is get the domain back &#8211; But because they won&#8217;t respond to me, there isn&#8217;t much I can do. These are pretty decent domain names too. </p>
<p>My suggestion to every one is to do the painstaking read of the service agreement &#8211; AND almost every registrar probably has similar verbiage about reselling your domain name. So, if you lose a name, just make sure they don&#8217;t profit, and send them a certified letter telling them you don&#8217;t want them to  &#8220;find a 3rd party interested in registering the name&#8221; as NameSecure so shrewdly puts it. </p>
<p>And, do I need to warn about staying away from certain registrar companies?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

			<p>For a peek into what happens at that 2:00 PM EST &#8220;witching hour&#8221; when expired domains are slated for deletion, see the transcript of the June 27, 2006 ICANN meeting:  Domain Name Marketplace Workshop</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icann.org/meetings/marrakech/captioning-dn-27jun06.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.icann.org/meetings/marrakech/captioning-dn-27jun06.htm</a></p>
<p>Go about 2/3 down the transcript, where Pat Kane of Verisign starts discussing &#8220;add storming&#8221;.  Fascinating.  Some basic stats about this &#8220;add storming&#8221; period:</p>
<p>60 million add requests each day for expired domains<br />
26,000 domain names deleted each day (average)<br />
Result:  about 2,300 requests to acquire each expired domain name (&#8220;drop catch&#8221;).<br />
Most all of this activity occurs within the 1:30 to 3:30 PM EST period.</p>
<p>Over 650 &#8220;production registars&#8221; participate in this daily random access event to grab these expired domain names.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And once many are had, they are simply put up for a few days (the five day grace period) to simply see how much traffic is still coming to them OR if the original owner will pay an extreme price to have the  name back.  If they appear to &#8220;pay for themselves&#8221; (i.e. they can generate more than the $6 it costs to register them via pay per click traffic), one of these 650 production registrars will fully register them or transfer to the original owner.  If not, they are once again dropped and become available (as we have seen from discussions above).</p>
<p>This explotation of the five day grace period is apparently causing a lot of headaches.  Note that some firms are promoting this grace period as a feature service (example:  Pool.com now advertises this as a new &#8220;Catch and Release&#8221; service).  Not really the intended purpose, which was originally provided to give registrars the ability to fix typos or remove registrationis paid for with fraudulent credit cards, etc.</p>
<p>The posting by &#8220;Casper&#8221; (#434) raises an interesting concept.  To compete in this &#8220;wild west random raffle&#8221; of expired domain names, why not start a grass roots effort to create a distributed computing grab system and compete with the some 650 others in this market?  Well, the first major hurdle is becoming an accredited registrar.  For more details see:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation.htm</a></p>
<p>and most importantly note the financial considerations:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation-financials.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.icann.org/registrars/accreditation-financials.htm</a></p>
<p>$2500 app fee, $4000 annual dues, $? quarterly ICANN operating expense fee&#8230;and at least $70K in the bank for operating expenses.  Certainly not unreasonable&#8230;but then again, enough of an obstacle to keep any ingenious developer at bay.</p>
<p>OK.  But let&#8217;s say we get this behind us (1,000 of us pony up $100 each).  Now what?  We have to now compete with those 60 million existing add requests hitting Verisign.   Some &#8220;back of the envelope&#8221; technical calcuations.  </p>
<p>Bandwidth:</p>
<p>Say we aim to get 5% of the names up for grabs.  This would mean we need to get in about 3 million add submissions within the 2 hour window.  Let&#8217;s also assume (unknown!) that a typical add submission is about 5 Kbytes (I really have no detailed knowledge of this exchange, this is a big assumption).  This would mean about:</p>
<p>5 KBytes/submission x 3,000,000 submissions/2 hours = 15 GBytes/2 Hours</p>
<p>= 2.08 MBytes/sec </p>
<p>= 16.67 Mbits/sec   (8 bits/byte)</p>
<p>Distribute this among, say, half of our &#8220;registered&#8221; user base at any given day (500 users) and we only need 0.03 Mbit/sec connections.  </p>
<p>Certainly bandwidth would not be a problem.  Even if the add transaction was 50KBytes, we should have no bandwidth restrictions in this distributed model.</p>
<p>Processes (TCP connections):</p>
<p>The next question is how many TCP connections (processes) would a single user have to maintain? </p>
<p>3,000,000 submissions (connections)/500 users = 6,000 connections/user</p>
<p>This would be over the 2 hour period.</p>
<p>6,000 connections/7200 secs = 0.83 connections (processes)/sec</p>
<p>There would definitely be some overlap in processes due to the TCP exchange, but overall this number of processes per user should be easily handled by most computers&#8230;.especially if they were just &#8220;idling&#8221; (e.g. in screen saver mode).</p>
<p>This distributed grab approach for expired domain names is an interesting idea.  Technically there appears to be no reason it could not be accomplished.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is would this make economic sense?  If we obtained 5% of the expired domain names, this would mean we would get about:</p>
<p>26,000/day * 0.05 = 1300 domain names/day</p>
<p>If only 10% of these names could be monetized for at least $10 profit (acquired either by selling the domain or getting PPC revenue) we would have:</p>
<p>1300 * .1 * $10 = $1300/day</p>
<p>Give us about 350 good &#8220;working&#8221; days per year, and we arrive at about $455,000/year.  Hmmm.  Worth it or not?  Game on?</p>

			<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>Interesting story. I do however have a few remarks. We are in the expired domain business for a while.</p>
<p>1. The number of domain names that expire daily is about 60,000.<br />
2. The major problem is that most domain are not intersted at all. Mybe 100 &#8211; 200 domain names are intersted. So every one is hunting at only 100 domains each day. You must be lucky to get 1 domain each day (we don&#8217;t get more).<br />
3. Only 1 out of 30 times the old domain holder is interested in buying his domain name back. And mostly not willing to pay more then 200 dollars. It&#8217;s also possible that there is a trademark on the domain and you have to give it back!</p>

<p>I have a question: What CMS are you using for newsvine?<br />
Thanks<br />

			<p>It&#8217;s not 100 procent possible to prevent domain dropping. Still some tips:</p>
<p>1. Create unique content with (almost) the same topic as the previous site.<br />
2. Do NOT put Google Adsense on the new site. This will for 90% kill your SEO. Nore, affiliate links. It&#8217;s ok, to add them after a few month.<br />
3. Keep the down time as low as possible.</p>
<p>Does anybody have more tips? I like to hear them</p>
<p>Kind regards<br />

			<p>Wow&#8230;  I was very happy to find this article and read through the first hundred replies before gazing down to see exactly how many responses there were&#8230;  needless to say, i did not read all of the other 300-some queries and answers.  But, I do have a question (maybe two), so I apologize if this repeats something covered previously.</p>
<p>So, a domain that I would like to own expired a couple days ago.  It was registered with Register.com.  Is there a primary/exclusive agreement in play for this registrar, like i&#8217;ve seen exists between SnapNames and NetworkSolutions?  Am I going to have to wait until mid-March for any sort of resolution?  I don&#8217;t expect that this URL is going to command much heat, its more of a personal interest and it wasn&#8217;t being used heretofore and the associated domains are available.  Given this scenario, is a backorder on GoDaddy as big of a waste as everyone around here seems to think it is?</p>
<p>Also, everyone here seems kind of suspicious of all the private elements in this process, is it possible that by making too many inquiries about my desired domain that I may in fact be generating the type of interest that would attract a dropcatcher and lead me to ultimately pay a higher price?  Kinda like the old joke where if you call and ask the FBI if they have a file on you, they&#8217;ll start one&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks so much for anyone who can answer these questions for me!  And great article and blog, Mike!  Congrats on getting your site, it looks great.</p>
<p>TM</p>

			<p>This is the Holy Grail for FAQâ€™s on expiring domainsâ€¦â€¦. Bar None.</p>
<p>My story is way back in early 1997 being new to the web at the time there were only a handful of registrars to work with.<br />
You were stuck with a .com or .net or .org or .gov<br />
The old days it was not uncommon to purchases a .com domain from the granddaddy â€œNetwork Solutionsâ€ for $75 bucks.<br />
Back then that is what it cost for one domain name and you had to fax proof what your company did and or how you were going to use the new domain (personal / business) E-commerce / on-line ordering, what was that If I am not mistaken SSL / encryption was not even 128 so to order a domain â€œon-lineâ€ was just not there.<br />
It was a sin to have a .net if you were not a ISP / web related and a .org was for strictly organizations â€œBlue Crossâ€ Etc.<br />
So the only variations were some long .com name and at the time ICANN I believe just bumped the maximum characters to 24 (www.bla-bla-bla-bla.com)<br />
Good thing because my company name at the time changed and was exactly 24 characters continuous with no spaces.<br />
Soon there after our company changed to a 4 character name &#038; it was a rush to get the .com but it was taken already.<br />
Well back in 1999 the .com I wanted it was expiring and my chance to take.<br />
NetSol had at the time a service to pick up the drop domain in which I purchased for a good $$$$ amount if I remember.<br />
Well NetSol never followed thru and a provider in Korea picked up my dream .com.<br />
I was ferrous, and after many hours on the phone with NetSol &#038; excuses the bottom line was I lost the domain.<br />
Around 99~2000 they unregulated the .org and .net (or registrars did not need proof of industry) so then the frenzy started al over again.<br />
Just recently I purchased my long waited .com from the provider in Korea for a undisclosed amount ïŒ<br />
But fortunately during that 7 years I locked up all other possible TDLâ€™s for our company.</p>
<p>BTW for people that do not to spend 3 hours to read all the blog the domain that Mike has is <a href="http://www.newsvine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsvine.com</a> even though it is listed multiple times throughout the blog some people just want the punch line right nowâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.</p>

			<p>A domain I like on gandi.net is apparently expired and listed with the following info:</p>
<p>Registrar: GANDI<br />
   Whois Server: whois.gandi.net<br />
   Referral<br />
   Name Server: No nameserver<br />
   Status: pendingDelete<br />
   Expiration Date: 26-oct-2006</p>
<p>According to Gandi.net it should become available approximately this Saturday, Dec. 30th, 2006, 65 days after expiration.</p>
<p>Do you know which dropcatchers would be best to use to grab this domain?</p>
<p>Which dropcatchers can I trust to be really working to help me as opposed to stealing the domain themselves?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

			<p>This was a great article.  I have watched some expiring domains myself and wondered just how hard it would be to take them.  On the flip side I have lost domains that were well within the 45 day grace period and had my renewal attempts denied repeatedly.  I assumed someone at the registrar had decided it was too good of a name to let go again.</p>
<p>Is there anything we can do legally to fight back (with any chance of winning on a normal persons budget) against a registrar who it appears has taken our domain away from us within that 45 day period?</p>

			<p>Great article and many informative/inspiring posts. Like many readers I ran across this article while looking into how to obtain an expiring domain.  Figured I&#8217;d relay my experience:</p>
<p>I was a bit leary of the drop catchers at first and figured they would rig the bidding and make the price go way up.  But the more I read the more I realized that if I wanted this name I would have to employ the big three drop catchers to catch it for me. </p>
<p>I decided to go the safe route and go through all three (snapnames, pool and enom&#8217;s clubdrop), but, before doing my research I had already backordered through Godaddy, which although a great company, their backordering is useless unless the name is registered through them already.  Godaddy does however keep you updated with all the name status changes through email (delete pending ,etc).</p>
<p>So, I backordered and waited for a little over two months for the drop.  On the day that the name became available I received an emal from Club Drop telling me that they had successfully captured the name for me.  To my surprise, nobody else bid on the name and it was mine for $60 + registration fee.  </p>
<p>So the moral of this story is if you want the name then use the big three to get it for you &#8211; it is like buying insurance only you won&#8217;t be charged if they don&#8217;t catch the name.</p>

			<p>there is something weird about expired domains.<br />
If no one bids on a domain till dropping period end , it get bought very fast for sure at a very low price.<br />
I checked many of today&#8217;s dropped domains, which were never bided.<br />
and they were all sold out at the exact day of dropping.<br />
I check longest &#038; meaningless ones with worst letters. they all sold out.<br />
what happens to domains after they dropped?<br />
is there any website to offer dropped domains which you can make a list and as soon as it dropped the site buy it at normal price? (usualy about 5$ to 10$)</p>

			<p>These domains are now caught by tasters. These people register the domains to try them for a few days, see if they have traffic, then release them again if they don&#8217;t. If you like a domain and it is registered the day of deletion and does not go to one of the above mentioned drop catching services, try back in 4-6 days and it may be available again.</p>

			<p>Very nice story, I kinda know how you feel with the bidding against you, was it the company or was it really another bidder :) At the end of the day you got your domain though. A friend of mine has similar scenario, they had website mybst, however they had the uk ending and not the com, and they really realyl wanted it, suprise suprise a few days later out of chance they checked on it, it was available. <a href="http://www.mybst.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybst.com</a></p>
<p>Your news site looks good by the way :)</p>

			<p>There are about 15 different companies that taste domains, these companies deposit anywhere from a few $100,000 to $1,000,000 in an account at the registry to try these names. The deposit is used to buy the domains, and if the company decides not to keep them after 5 days, the funds are refunded to the deposit account.</p>
<p>There are a few registrars that allow individuals or small companies to to taste domains for a small fee, generally $0.15-$0.50 per domain that is tasted.<br />

			<p>Is anyone here has an experience about the domain that you wish to buy, but then got snapped by whois company you were using for domain research??<br />
Be careful not to use Godaddy and all his sister company.<br />
I think when someone researching domain through their whois service, they might sell it to 3rd party who may need it.<br />
Pls give your opinions guys&#8230;:)</p>

			<p>I just found the article and this thread. Read all of it. Where did the time go? Anyway, great article and very interesting comments.</p>
<p>I read it all even though I currently have no interest in an expired domain. Still, being in the internet business since 1995, this is one area I never really understood. Have many domain names for various business reasons, never speculated. </p>
<p>Have sold some names ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. Have just let some great generic names go. I wonder what people paid for them?<br />
I think they are good, certainly compared to all the garbage I see for sale on various sites. They included bookscribe.com, greetings-gifts.com and gayglobe.com.  Had these names for over 10 years and never developed them properly and got tired of paying the NetSol fees.</p>

			<p>I have a small portfolio, does anyone have any suggestions as to the best way to sell my domain/domains, mainly the last 2 I have just registered, they are the full name of an up and coming sports personality, I have both the .com and the .co.uk.<br />
After your comments I certainly don&#8217;t wish to fall into the hands of these sharks.<br />
Any thoughts would be appreciated, cheers guy&#8217;s.</p>

			<p>I have been a frequent user of Monikerâ€™s multiple domains checker, <a href="https://www.moniker.com/pub/DomainCheckBatch," rel="nofollow"></a><a href="https://www.moniker.com/pub/DomainCheckBatch" rel="nofollow">https://www.moniker.com/pub/DomainCheckBatch</a>, to check the availability of domains.  Two days ago (4/22/2007) in the evening, I used it to check for a domain, â€œoppsex.comâ€.  It is a good name, but I did not register it right away.  It has been deleted since 4/14/2007, so I was thinking that it will still be there the next day morning when I got up.  The next day when I checked the domain, it was registered by BELGIUMDOMAINS, LLC, a Washington Limited Liability Corporation performing domain name registration and other services under the name of BelgiumDomains, during my sleep.  I said to myself, could this been a coincident or the info (the domain name) that I checked was abused by the Moniker that they took the domain names that were checked using on their site and went register before the users when they spotted a good domain name?</p>
<p>Since there was a 10 hours window between the time that I checked when it was still available and the time when it became unavailable, I said to myself again that this is probably a coincident.  But the suspicious flag was raised.  </p>
<p>Yesterday (4/23/2007), I checked my deleted domain database that I subscribe and found â€œmoneyhat.comâ€.  It was deleted on 4/14/07 and still available at the time I checked.  So this time I immediately registered it through 1and1.com.  It went through this time and the status of the process was â€œWaiting for approvalâ€ and I was very sure that I will get it.  Fourteen hours later, I got an email from 1and1.com, saying that:</p>
<p>You have requested the registration of the following domain name(s):<br />
moneyhat.com<br />
Unfortunately, the domains you have requested were not available or could not be registered due to the policies of the registration authority (NIC).<br />
We have removed the requests for the above mentioned domain names from your package, with no charge to you.</p>
<p>This had never happened before.  Could someone beat me to it few seconds before I registered that even 1and1.com registering system did not pick up because the time was too short?  Who would that person be?  I checked the Who is for â€œmoneyhat.comâ€ and found something very unrest.  The domain was registered by Moniker on the same day (4/23/2007) that I registered it.</p>
<p>Domain Name: MONEYHAT.COM<br />
Registrar: MONIKER ONLINE SERVICES, INC.<br />
Whois Server: whois.moniker.com<br />
Referral<br />
Name Server: NS2.PARKINGPANEL.COM<br />
Name Server: NS1.PARKINGPANEL.COM<br />
Status: clientTransferProhibited<br />
Status: clientUpdateProhibited<br />
Status: clientDeleteProhibited<br />
Updated Date: 23-apr-2007<br />
Creation Date: 23-apr-2007<br />
Expiration Date: 23-apr-2008</p>
<p>Later, I found out that Moniker is also a domain auction house when I spotted this article on the Web:  Domain Market Keeps Motoring Along With Trio of Six-Figure Sales at Moniker/DomainSystems at <a href="http://www.dnjournal.com/domainsales.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dnjournal.com/domainsales.htm</a></p>
<p>This is the last time that I will use their online tool.</p>

<p>We used one of the services listed in this post to conduct a trial based on your commentary.</p>
<p>We were outbid on the first attempt and were succesful on the second. </p>
<p>Grab a 6 year old domain with decent PR and a great name.</p>

I read your article and it was fascinating although it isn&#8217;t of any help at the moment.<br />
There is a domain I am wishing to buy but although the who is info suggests it expired in July 2006 it still states it is taken&#8230;<br />
This exceeds the 75 day&#8217;s mentioned so how can this be and what can I do about it?<br />
Anyone know please?  I don&#8217;t want to email the &#8220;owner&#8221; because he will either re &#8211; register or as k a silly price.<br />
Thanks.<br />

			<p>In reply to Anthony&#8217;s post # April 24, 2007 06:05 AM</p>
<p>I have used 123-reg.co.uk which is the Pipex Group for my .co.uk domains and <a href="http://ukwebsolutionsdirect.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://ukwebsolutionsdirect.co.uk</a> for .com domains, both based on price and reliability and can honestly say I have never had a pick of bother and I have used them for years now (free page with 123-reg).<br />
Definitely think I would be looking very closely at the hosts you have used way too much of a coincidence, more chance of winning the lottery that what happened in your case, sounds a bit fishy to me.</p>
<p>Good luck with future searches.<br />

			<p>Thanks Max.  Right now I would rather do the availability check the slow way &#8211; check them one by one using my hosting provider&#8217;s tool.  Once a particular domain of interest is available, I can register it right away.  (Unforfunately, even this method is the sure one.  Got bad experience today, but it is another story.)</p>
<p>By the way, does anyone knows if a domain with &#8220;.bz&#8221; TLD worth anything even if the domain name is a generic word like &#8220;finances&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Thanks for the great article.  I went looking for information because I had a backorder with GoDaddy on a domain registered with GoDaddy.  Twenty days after the expiration date, I get a message that I have the first bid in the auction for my domain.  What???  GD had control of it and through it to the wind.  I&#8217;ve been a GD customer for quite a while and I did not understand why they would do this to me.  Your article cut through the fog.  I still like Gordon Gekko even though I&#8217;m on the other side of &#8220;greed is good.&#8221;</p>

			<p>My hosting company renewed my hosting package, but allowed my <b>.com</b> domain name to be snatched by ENOM&#8230;  I got my hosting company to register the <b>.net</b> version of my domain by way of an apology&#8230;</p>
<p>Now here we are, coming up on a year after the .com was snatched, and ENOM still hasn&#8217;t unloaded it (which I could have told them, since it&#8217;s an unusual name and we&#8217;re perfectly happy with the .net version).  Naturally, I&#8217;m interested in getting the domain back, but not so interested that I&#8217;m going to spend too much on the attempt.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it gets, in my opinion, kind of shady.  The placeholder site doesn&#8217;t reveal the current site owner, but a WhoIs query reveals <i>ENOM, INC</i> as the Registrar while the actual registrant is hidden behind the veil of <i>Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc.</i>  I&#8217;m willing to bet, though, that ENOM itself owns the site.  Now, a quick trip to <b>enom.com</b> leads us to their domain name registration link, and checking on the .com I lost gets me a referral to <b>afternic.com</b> where I am invited to place a bid on the domain &#8211; provided the bid is at least $200.  (Funny thing about that afternic.com website&#8230; the ENOM logo is right there in the site header!)  So, like I said&#8230; shady.  I mean, if they own the site I lost (which I&#8217;m sure they do) then why should I have to bid $200 for it when places like Hostway register new domains for under $10.</p>
<p>So, anyone know how I might get around this?  And what is the chance that after a year, ENOM might abandon the domain they grabbed and let it drop?</p>

			<p>Thanx for the info. I just managed to acquire a dropping domain that I needed for a music project I&#8217;m working on: (tokolos.com)<br />
I back ordered the domain name through: clubdrop.com, snapnames.com and pool.com<br />
I also back ordered the name through dotropolis.com (godaddy.com reseller) and the name was no longer available for back order through any godaddy.com related sites.<br />
The service that snatched the name for me was: clubdrop.com (enom)<br />
I think I was the only interested party. The domain was previously registered through an australian registrar.</p>

			<p>HI MIke,<br />
WOW this has been a very interesting blog and very worthwhile to read! Very informative from info from all concerned with their experiences with the domain business and acquiring techniques etc.</p>
<p>I had a very similar experience very recently, when i went after a named PR 7 from the software i was using to locate the top ranked names. I checked the whois and the usual checking issues and also tested the name on godaddy for its availability (where i park a lot of my unused domains at) and it was available so i grabbed it and piad right then immediatley within 3 minutes all paid for and theni get a email informing me there wa s aamistake in the registering the domain and it was not now available and that my money was being refunded???? I wrote a stinking letter to them in Phoenix where they are based and complained bitterly over this shoddy way of conducting business and am awaiting a reply from them now. Which i will update on here later.</p>
<p>Has anyone else ben screwed over a good PR name like this through registering a name with godaddy ?</p>

			<p>Damn shame this type of situation isnt possible today (this article is over 2 years old). Major domain companies are buying up the good names. Not possible to get a a good name now unless you are willing to pay huge $$$ for it.</p>
<p>BTW Go Daddy&#8217;s Backorder is a waste of time. I have never heard of ANYONE getting a domain when using GD&#8217;s service.</p>

That how I got <a href="http://www.WAPages.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.WAPages.net</a> .biz .org .com. .biz.. Someone else was able to grab .us &#8230; but thats not important ;]. Good luck!</p>

			<p>Excellent article. Reading through the comments, I noticed that there were several comments about the actions of the registrars. The law firm CyberLaw routinely handles these types of matters, and we&#8217;ve seen some similar complaints about domain registrations. If anyone has particular situations that they&#8217;ve encountered, we&#8217;re happy to hear about them and may potentially be of service to you. Link is above.</p>
<p>Thanks again for a fine article and the discussion about the various practices.</p>

			<p>My friend had his domain registered with Enom for a 1 year subscription, which was set it expire on May 31st.  Enom says that they hold your website for 30 days after the expiry date and you can re-register.</p>
<p>12 days later and his website has already been sold.</p>
<p>I check Whois and apparently the website expired 22 April, 1 month and 9 days before the real expiry date.<br />
I guess thatâ€™s what you get for you extra money bidding with Enom, a shortened expiry date for the real domain holder.</p>

			<p>Bingo!  I agree 100%&#8230; parking is what is hot, not the development of cool domains.  The hot domains are those that get web traffic&#8230;. just for giggles&#8230; try a web search on two domains, <a href="http://www.go-disney.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.go-disney.com</a>  or <a href="http://www.JG-Wentworth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.JG-Wentworth.com</a> &#8230;.  These two examples will show you what I am talking about&#8230;.  you will find those two domains at the top of the Google web crawler&#8230; why?  Because whoever owns the domains thought outside of the box.</p>

			<p>Great read.  I learned about these services many years ago and was able to get several good names mostly because no one wanted to pay $60 for a domain.  No although I backorder many, I don&#8217;t get any.  They go into auction.</p>
<p>I do have an interesting situation I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out and am suspecting something fishy but maybe not.</p>
<p>I have some friends that were going to get married. Being in the business, I offerered to create the wedding web site.  They both go by nick names to me.  One is an off-the-wall nick name and one is a shortened version of a hispanic name.  About four months out we discussed the particulars of the website and were getting ready to register the domain name {bridenickname}and{groomnickname}.com.  Within a 3-5 five day period we must have hit the domain name (not yet registered) maybe 20-50 times between all of us.  Mostly curiosity on Google, etc. because we already knew the name was available and unlikely to be taken (not like it contained any good key words pet, etc. &#8211; nothing like that). </p>
<p>Anyway, when I went to register this really bizarre name &#8211; trust me, it was gone.  The site has a directory of stuff &#8211; travel, cell phones, apartments, etc.  And, my friends&#8217; nick-names, both of them, appear as items.</p>
<p>I suspect our repeatly trying the domain and searching for it prompted someone to register it.  It was only three of us so the most we could have messed around with it was 50 or so times.  I thought the names may have some meaning in another language so I searched but nothing really comes up. </p>
<p>Long story short &#8211; we flipped the nick-names around and registered that name.  Did the job fine.  Michael A.</p>

			<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>My boss at work recently asked me to enquire as to how to purchase the .com equivalent of his domain.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found since that the domain is owned by Go Daddy and due to expire in July.</p>
<p>What do you feel my best course of action is?</p>
<p>Am I able to just place an exclusive backorder with Go Daddy or do you feel I&#8217;ll need to bid with snapnames, enom and pool to secure the domain?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

			<p>Great story.  I didn&#8217;t have a chance to read all of the post&#8217;s follow up comments&#8230;so I hope this isn&#8217;t a repeat question.  However, are the &#8220;big 3&#8243; still &#8220;Snapnames.com, Enom.com, and Pool.com?&#8221;  Two years (from the time you wrote this) is a long time in &#8220;Internet time&#8221; and so I&#8217;m wondering if this has changed?  </p>
<p>Maybe a periodic update on this would be good.  I think many people would be interested in this topic.  According to wordtracker.com, there&#8217;s been 701 searches on the phrase (or permutations of) &#8220;expired domain name&#8221; which led me to your site today since you have the nice little benefit of being #2 in Google&#8217;s search results when people type that in.  Can&#8217;t say if you are #2 with all the different permutations, but you get the main phrase at least.  :)</p>
<p>Anyway, I think we write alike &#8212; so I like your writing &#8212; and I&#8217;m from Seattle.  So, two little coincidents/similarities between us.  Thanks for the story &#038; good luck to my fellow Seattleite!  Cheers.</p>

			<p>Thanks for the article.  As a new author, I was advised to use my personal name to set up my web site and use my book title.  My book title name is available, my personal name is not.  Who would have thought that some college kid put up a site using MY (our) personal name?  I&#8217;m a baby boomer.  If I had registered my name 10 years ago, she would have still been playing with Barbie dolls back then, not selling stuff online.  Now I find she hasn&#8217;t paid her renewal bill&#8230; YEAH for broke college kids.  Now I am going to use your advice to get (myname).com</p>

			<p>Hey All,<br />
 Thanks for the article first off, it was a great reference to start with. Sadly it didn&#8217;t help in my situation, I was trying to get a great domain for a client and was  operating under the assumption that we had 75 total days to work with. Somehow Network Solutions dropped the domain to Snap Names after 36 days and the auction on the domain is now closed&#8230; fantastically shady black box dealing imo&#8230; I didn&#8217;t see that time frame referenced anywhere but the fellow at snapnames said its standard practice. Really a lovely experience and I can&#8217;t wait to go and tell the client that I couldn&#8217;t get the domain for them :(. Thanks for the info though! Rule #4080&#8230; the industry is shaaaaaaddddyyyyy. :)</p>

			<p>My domain expired and went in to auction by several drop catchers and never got sold to any one till I realize that all this happened. The domain was used for personal purpose and no one will have interest on it. Now I want the domain back and is now sitting with enom and they locked it with clienttransferprohibited. Is there a way to get it back from them? How long does it sit there with them. Looks like I have to spend $200 bucks for it to get it back. I do not want to spend that much money on it.  Is there a way that it will come back to public so that I can register as a complete new/fresh domain?</p>

			<p>Wow, what a story about purchasing expired domains!  We trust a lot the integrity of these firms handling the snatching, right? I say that because we do not know who the bidders are exactly.  And suppose just for a moment that someone on the other side decided to great insincere bids building up the price?</p>
<p>Just a thought, right?  I have a domain with a hosting service that delays the process of releasing domains so customers can find another hosting service.  That domain expires soon, and I plan to acquire it and move it to a new or different host.  As the article articulates, it&#8217;s a seventy five day process.  I wonder if my current domain host could find out that I am attempting to snatch my domain name and perhaps they might attempt to snatch it for themselves?  </p>
<p>Or the host could create an unintentional bid(s) for my domain name to make me pay more spitefully.  Integrity, I wonder.  Just a thought.  I hope this is not a practice by anyone, right?  &#8212; Pall Stanley</p>

<p>As I noted recently, my domain is set to expire this week, but I&#8217;ve initiated a transfer to a new registrar. The process is surprisingly slow (we&#8217;re on Day 3), and as I said, I&#8217;ve been a little curious to see what happens if the expiration date comes a&#8230;</p>

			<p>Well this blog certainly explains the way in this messy came of domain registering and backordering. Thanks to this site I got what I wanted. These are the lessons learned. 1) Its not so clear who is good, bad and ugly. I got my name through snapnames. GoDaddy just took my money and they even do not have a clue that the name is allreadyu gone! 2) if you want certain name then use the snatching company that is in close affiliation with the company who currently has the name. Mine was aquired by oregonnames and thus snapnames had a good chance (ha-ha, they are the same company so snapnames already got it!) to get it. Total investment to snapnames USD 19 that includes one year registration. Me happy!</p>

The domain registrar industry, once subtle and behind the scenes, is starting  to appear on regulator&#8217;s radar screens.  Their ability to affect whole industries will attract more and more scrutiny (and perhaps, antitrust action).  For now, we&#8217;ll all have to figure out the rules as we go along and use threads like this as our guidelines.</p>

<p>I wish the process was fair to all hard working Americans but as long as the unethical behavior of many individuals/companies continues along with their advantageous computer power to slam/re.register quicker then individuals it shall never change</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.i think unethical=gray area=capitalism=can u afford the penalty if u get caught</p>
<p>ex. I live in the big city and it is always cheaper for me to park at an expired meter and risk the $25 ticket then to park in a parking garage at about $40</p>

			<p>Thanks for posting this. Great article and a great insight into the shadowy world of domain renewals. </p>
<p>I too recently needed to backorder a quite valuable domain name which was in the process of deleting from the registry. After trying to put in a backorder at Godaddy only to be told that someone else already had and therefore I could not, I found this article and put the process to the test.</p>
<p>I backordered the name through Snapnames, Club Drop and Pool.com. Sure enough, when the domain deleted it was picked up by Club Drop and I went into the auction process for it along with 9 other &#8216;bidders&#8217;.</p>
<p>The whole process felt quite shady. You never know who else is in the auction or wheather there are ringers in there to try to bring the price up. My guess and gut feeling is that there was. Anyway, the auction went to a couple of hundred dollars and I did secure the domain. </p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have been successful without having read this. Thanks again.</p>

			<p>Some very intresting facts, unfortunately I can&#8217;t afford anything like that.  I was wondering though how much a person would pay for an unregistered domain name.  You see I was playing around with namecheap.com and disscovered a few unregistered names.  Unfortunately I can not pay rent for a place to live let along be able to pay to have names registered but it got me thinking about whether not people would buy an unregistered name and at what price?  Because it would be iffy on what the name is because no seller would tell the buyer the name before payment since the domain would be unregistered.  Plus were would the seller find such buyers?  These are just questions that I have been trying to find the answers for.  Anyone know anything?</p>

			<p>hi,<br />
i was just looking up a domain name on bustaname site using their Quick Domain Check feature and it showed that it was available. I quickly proceeded to buy it, but to my surprise it turned out to be already registered. Interestingly enough the registration date was 11/02/2007! Coincidence or are their queries being monitored and intercepted, etc.?!?! Which of the whois services had most up-to-date info?</p>

			<p>Interesting info but I prefer a different strategy which you never mentioned. True, after expiry/redemption/deletion, the domain will be snatched by one of the sharks (Snapnames et al). But if you play it cool, you may be able to get it without a fight.</p>
<p>Typically the sharks are stupid. That is, they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ve got because they just swallow names en masse (I guess more like whales eating plankton than sharks). I have learned that they will hold on to the name for 3 days (the auction period) during which they try to figure out if they can get any money for it. If people are stupid and bid in the auction (no offense to the author of this article) that&#8217;s like tipping them off that they&#8217;re onto a moneymaker.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you let the 3 days expire without a fuss, the sharks will assume that the domain is junk (like the millions of others) and throw it back&#8211;cancel their registration without paying. What they do is the equivalent of &#8220;buying&#8221; a prom dress, wearing it to the prom and then returning it for a refund the next day. Totally unethical and rather disgusting.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s how you win. Simply don&#8217;t play the game. After 3 days if they get no bids, they dissolve the registration record, and on the 4th day bright and early you can register it for $5. I have done this twice and I&#8217;m doing it again as we speak.</p>
<p>The key is: BE COOL. We all know you want the domain and are willing to pay $1000 for it. But keep a poker face. You&#8217;ll profit, and you&#8217;ll drive these unethical sharks out of business to boot. Give it a try next time!!!</p>

			<p>Shane: Definitely a reasonable strategy, but I wouldn&#8217;t apply it unless I was ok with *not* getting the domain.  If you really want the domain, that strategy is a bit risky.  If it&#8217;s just a domain you wouldn&#8217;t mind having, however, then great.  My $369 <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2007/10/msnbc.com-acquires-newsvine" rel="nofollow">worked out pretty well</a> in the end though. :)</p>

Pool.com&#8217;s system sounds horrid and I don&#8217;t want to end up paying through the nose for a domain that&#8217;s probably not in high demand.</p>

			<p>Very useful information; however I personally wouldn&#8217;t wait 75 days to get my hands on a domain name if I was setting up a business.

			<p>Really depends on the business Mike. However, setting up any business is a project and if you have 75 days that you can build in to that project plan while you&#8217;re waiting for the domain then fine. Now I&#8217;m no business guru but I do know that my customers want to move faster than that, and among the real hardcore guys I deal with I have one who had a business concept that was turning over 6 figures in 6 weeks and another who had a 6 billion GBP turnover construction company on his books within 6 months.  Lots of 6s in there, but you get the idea &#8211; I&#8217;m just saying that ideally, you want to hit the ground running, and that 75 days is a long time to wait for anything that you have a great deal of control over, such as picking up a domain name. Just doesn&#8217;t seem that mission critical to me.</p>
<p>No offence was meant, but it looks like it was taken, so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be back on this blog in a hurry, Mmmkay.</p>

			<p>Chris: Nope, no offense taken at all.  There is nothing to be offended about.  I&#8217;m just kind of calling bullshit on the concept that any real &#8220;business&#8221; can be a) thought of, b) branded, c) executed on from a web site perspective, and d) pulling in any substantial amount of visitors&#8230; all within 7 days.  I&#8217;m sure there are some examples that may actually do that, but it&#8217;s less than 1 out of 100 businesses. Certainly not the norm or anything close to it.  If you&#8217;re in the school of thought that says brand and domain aren&#8217;t mission critical, then sure, why would you even be looking at the expiring domain market?  Just grab reely-cheep-used-cars.com and be on your way.  But the point of this article is that there are plenty of potentially great brand opportunities out there right now, with the only problem being that the associated domains have been snapped up.  If you really like the brand opportunity (e.g. Newsvine), there are no trademark issues, and you&#8217;re willing to go through the process described above, you can do quite well.</p>

			<p>Mike, I appreciated the article and the excellent writing skills you exercised.  I have a slightly different problem and wondered if you would have a comment.  I want to buy a domain name that does not expire until September 2008.  I tried contacting the owner via the WHOIS information but the phone number has been disconnected and he has not replied to my email.  The &#8220;parking spot&#8221; is domainhouse.com, and I could find no way to register there to be next in line.  I am stumped, any thoughts?  Thanks,  Mike</p>

<p>A general comment to Mike &#8211; it&#8217;s funny how small the world is. I google for stuff and your articles come up continually. Then I read the comments from people, and they&#8217;re people I see comments from elsewhere. Plus we live in the same city.</p>

			<p>GoDaddy has been holding my domain hostage for months now. Every time I go to log in it tells me I have an invalid email and an invalid domain name so I can not retrieve my customer # to renew. So I stupidly thought I would let it expire and repurchase it. However now that it&#8217;s been expired for 20 days, it is still not free to purchase. </p>
<p>I finally broke down and called GoDaddy and they said they &#8220;have no idea&#8221; why their online system isn&#8217;t working with my email and/or domain name and why when I give the last 4 digits of the credit card (the only one I have ever owned) it isn&#8217;t retrieving the info either. </p>
<p>If I can eventually get into the account that will be so kind as to charge me an $80 renewel fee because unlike what you said about the 40 day period GoDaddy only gives 12 days to renew at the regular rate. </p>
<p>I find this completely unfair considering it&#8217;s some kind of glitch in THEIR system that is keeping me from getting into my account. In fact we both agreed the email addy I was trying to use on their site WAS the one they had on file.</p>
<p>I will never ever register anything with them again as long as I live. They are a nightmare.</p>

			<p>I have found a domain name which would be a perfect fit for a new website I am working on. There is a website in existence with that domain name, but it is apparently a dead website, because when you click on Contact or Enquiries, a page comes up saying that the Page canot be found.</p>
<p>The site is registered with Tucows.<br />
It is due for renewal in August 2008.<br />
I note that a lot of the material which you provided concerning acquiring expiring domains is dated 2006 and I wonder if you know if any better way of getting an expiring domain has emerged since 2006?<br />
A lot of the blogs, etc. on this subject are also a few years old and ICANN doesn&#8217;t seem to have come to any helpful conclusion on what to do about this.<br />
To paraphrase Napoleon, for me it is a problem &#8211; for the &#8220;sharks&#8221; it is presumably an opportunity.</p>

			<p>Hi Mike, great article! And a successful one too. There are so many posts.</p>
<p>I am wondering about one thing: when I place the backorder on Pool.com, right after then, will it be posted on there &#8220;Deleting Domains&#8221; list and so other people will start seeing it and they will place the backorder too?</p>
<p>See it&#8217;d be perfect if I could avoid that, best case is still then when I am the only bidder. </p>
<p>2nd question is: when is the best timing to place that backorder? Do I need to do it before it &#8220;Expires&#8221;? before &#8220;PendingDeletion&#8221; starts? or if you know, when exactly is the threshhold</p>
<p>Thanks very such for such good info</p>

			<p>Well I&#8217;m about to put the timeline to the test.  I&#8217;ve seen refernece to another source that stretches the timeline Mike gives by up to 5 days. i.e.  instead of 75 days, it can be UP TO 80 days.  This may have merit because I&#8217;m well past 75 days. So great!  A few more days of waiting.  Am I correct to assume if the domain status is pendingDelete, that the registrars have passed on it and we little people actually stand a chance?????</p>
<p>Great article all around.</p>

			<p>What is the case if you are trying to snag an expiring trademarked name (your business name) does anyone know?</p>
<p>I own the domain name &#8220;Hydrologix.org&#8221; and also the US<br />
Registered Trademark for the name &#8220;Hydrologix&#8221;.</p>
<p>I approached the cyber squatter owner of it 2 years ago to buy the (.com) version name but they  wanted a high price ($1600). We told them we had a right to the name  for a fair price, and made an offer of $200, but they refused and<br />
accused us of &#8220;reverse hijacking&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then a private party bought it (the current owner) who asked our<br />
permission to use it and we told him no, he could not use it as it is our<br />
trademarked name. He hasn&#8217;t used it and it is due to expire any day now.</p>
<p>I have put in a backorder with snapnames and pool.com, but from what I&#8217;m reading here it&#8217;s going to get into the bidding war &#8211; how to avoid this?</p>

			<p>I am currently in this state, and I would like to know how long does one wait, or in your case how long do you wait to get on backorder. I realize this is all in essence a gamble, but if you dont gamble then you cant win or lose &#8212; it&#8217;s a chance worth taking. Now the particular domain I want is not set to expire until 3 years from now, do I wait until a year is left or do I start now? I dont know the procedure or right move for such a thing; please provide me with your wisdom, thank you.</p>

			<p>Very interesting post. Thank you.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that if Verisign&#8217;s idea of waiting list got implemented it would eliminate the drop.</p>
<p>Average domain price would be way lower than the fee so no one would get on the waiting list and a lot of stuff would still drop to be picked up and &#8220;tasted&#8221;.</p>
<p>It would open a new niche for people to track websites and as soon as rank, traffic and link profile start to look promising invest by getting first on the waiting list in a hope that enough domains expire and you would be able to auction them off at a profit.</p>

			<p>I visited pool.com / enom.com / snapnames.com . All have a list of enourmous domains which are for expiry. But i am not able to trace a single high quality generic domain. I think that the users allow their junk domains to expire without paying for their renewal. If by chance a good domain expires then there will be an auction and so many guys will bid. But so many good domains are still available for registration itself. the only thing is you have to search, do some brain storming process ETC. I have a nice portfolio of some 200 domains. All are premium descriptive Generic keywords. I have just registered not drop catched. So search search search  you will find.</p>
<p>Good Luck.</p>

			<p>Great article and I find it interesting.  I&#8217;m kinda hoping someone can steer me in the right direction for a domain name I have been keeping my eye on.  It is coming up to expire in July.  I currently have a &#8220;backorder&#8221; with GoDaddy for this name.  But I found that the name I want is currently owned by Network Solutions.  What are my chances of me getting it with GoDaddy?  </p>
<p>To be honest, the name isn&#8217;t that great big deal to me.  I&#8217;m a website amateur and am not going to be using it for any business or money making purposes.  So, I don&#8217;t want to spend hundreds of dollars for a &#8220;just because&#8221; reason.  I would be willing to pay up to the $50-60 range; but more than that it&#8217;s just not worth it.</p>
<p>Anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks!</p>

			<p>Hi Mike</p>
<p>The current registrar for the expiring domain name I&#8217;m aiming for is GODADDY?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken out a backorder with GoDaddy. Why would I also take out one with Snapnames.com, etc? Surely, seeing that the domain is currently held by GoDaddy, they have the edge in getting it for me.</p>
<p>If you reckon that it is worth also taking out a backorder with one or more of the others, which would you currently recommend? </p>
<p>I have had an existing domain with Network Solutions for years. Maybe that would give me an edge if I choose their snapnames.com service.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The birth of Newsvine.com? </p>
<p>it was very interesting to read this blog thinking it was some other website (because newsvine has just always existed in my mind) and then to read this &#8220;oh btw, i bought this little domain name called newsvine.com&#8221; like it was no big deal, little did you know 3 years, and lots of sweat later you were going to have one of the biggest community news sites on the internet.</p>

			<p>Great post.</p>
<p>Mike, how were you able to transfer newsvine to dreamhost &#8220;immediately&#8221; after your auction win?  </p>
<p>According to my hosting company I have to wait 60 days from initial registration before transferring a domain name, which I&#8217;m not keen on.  The registration date has become the date I purchased it which makes sense since I bought it once it had deleted via snapnames.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

			<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>I work for Network Solutions and wanted to mention a tool that your readers may find useful for tracking expiring domains.<br />
<a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/domain-name-registration/expiring-domains-rss.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.networksolutions.com/domain-name-registration/expiring-domains-rss.jsp</a><br />
 You have several options for searching keywords, length of the domain name, different extensions and get the feed through RSS. This is free for anyone and a account is not necessary.</p>
<p> I would also apprecaite any feedback if you have chance to try the tool. My email is shashib [at ] networksolutions    [com]</p>

			<p>I like your post!  I would like to backorder a name from the same registrar that the name is registered with.  How do I find that out?  I looked up the domain I want on the whois website and it said the below info (maybe moniker.com is the registrar&#8230;who knows????)&#8230;any ideas?  Thanks, Mark</p>

			<p>Thanks for the great article Mark!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more than 3 years old, and the comments still keep pouring.. :)</p>
<p>I bumped into your site when I search for information regarding expired domain.</p>
<p>I forgot (read : I procastinated) to renew one of my domain.  It&#8217;s not the main domain.  The main domain is .com and this is the .net version which was parked all the time.  It expired and now it&#8217;s in &#8216;PENDINGRENEWALDELETION&#8217; status.  It&#8217;s more than 40 days already, but still within 75 days.</p>
<p>The domain is not in my account anymore, so I can&#8217;t click renew to renew it.  When I contacted them, they say they can try to retrive it for $160,- fee.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit hefty, but then again it&#8217;s my fault.  (case still in progress, don&#8217;t know whether they will recover it for me as they said &#8220;can try to retrieve the domain&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Another Question, althought apparently i am a few years late for this blog.  There is a domain that i want very badly, and it expires in october. I I would like to make the guy an offer but the only way to do that is through network solutions(which is his registrar) They believe that i should offer more than 25,000, but they dont know this guy. The owner has no idea of domain vaules and hasnt been active with his company since 2006. I guess my question is, what is the best way to offer a bid without sparking the curiosity of the seller?</p>

			<p>As with all transactions aim low (I don&#8217;t know the domain name, but if its nothing too demanded like a single popular word -ie domain.com guy.com monkey.com etc. ) go like $500, if it IS a name that will be demanded I would shoot for 1-2 thousand.<br />

			<p>I can tell you this much, people are bidding on domains with good pagerank, for example if domain was solid PR6, with solid backlinks it&#8217;s very likely that the same will remain for a long time.<br />
Let&#8217;s say you purchase PR7 website with (i.e. 130 solid google backlinks) and you SEO that domain with pretty much any keywords you want or need, voila in next google indexing its guarantied top 10 or higher.<br />
From what I understand Hong Kongâ€™s famous wordpress blog site beccary.com with super-duper PR and fantastic Alexa rating was recently snatched by some Health Insurance affiliated business, google it and youâ€™ll see.<br />
GoDaddy Aftermarket is way to go.</p>

			<p>Re: Domains By Proxy and GoDaddy Drop Catching Process &#8211; 2008</p>
<p>I have been checking the Network Solutions whois on a daily basis for a name that expired in mid-April of 2008.  The Registrant and Registrar continue to be listed respectively as Domains By Proxy and GoDaddy.  When I click on the link &#8211; Show underlying registry data for this record  &#8211; in the Network Solutions whois for this name, the registry data specifies that five days past the expiration date an update to the system gave rise to a new expiration date that is one year from the previous termination date.  However, the new name servers point to DOMAINCONTROL.com.  The whois page also points to a URL from this phrase: &#8211; For complete domain details go to: [then it gives the URL].  That URL is a goDaddy.com whois page for the domain.  It reflects the mid-April 2008 termination date and there is no indication of renewal. </p>
<p>Can anyone help explain what is going on here?  Is the Registrar &#8220;tasting&#8221; traffic for this domain.  Can they legally snatch the name or must they let it drop?  Is there an innocent explanation like some kind of migratory process at work.</p>
<p>Sincere thanks for reading this post and sharing your valuable insights.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>CITR</p>

<p>The expiring .com I have my eyes on is a simple auto-forward to some Italian site with no relevance to the domain. It would seem my chances of grabbing it are low unless I&#8217;m willing to suffer like the author!</p>

			<p>Instead of going to auction, you might contact the guy (mail him, call him on phone if that works) who hasnt renewed and ask it for a decent price. You might stand a chance to gain that domain name, especially if the owner hasnt done much of work on the domain, but the name is very good for you. </p>

			<p>Wow&#8230; newsvine.com &#8211; do you still own it?</p>
<p>Where does Godaddy&#8217;s tdnam play in the whole expiration process?  I actually snatched a domain from someone else even though the owner had backordered (Godaddy) that domain himself.</p>
<p>Could the previous owner signed up for tdnam and get his domain back that way instead of backordering or pay $100 to Godaddy in the redemption period?</p>
<p>Thanks for the great info,<br />
Steve</p>

			<p>Hi Steve,<br />
For your question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Could the previous owner signed up for tdnam and get his domain back that way instead of backordering or pay $100 to Godaddy in the redemption period?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, the owner can join TDNAM to bid for that name. In fact if I was that owner, I will pay for redemption period (about $80) to ensure that I will get back the domain. This only can do if the domain still in the redemption time frame.</p>

			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Its a brilliant article. I am after a domain name from last few years and hopefully it will be expiring in few days. It is registered through speednames. As per the knowledge granted by the article and the comments, I guess the best bet is to find who is the partner of this registrar and then place backorder so as to have a guaranteed kind of thing. So, Do anyone have knowledge that who is the partner of speednames.com so as to avoid pool.com. Any help will be really appreciated.</p>

			<p>Not trying to sound like a broken record Mike but kudos on a really great article.  I&#8217;ve worked for Godaddy for a few years now and have seen plenty of successful backorders. Seeing that a backorder is not a guarantee they&#8217;ll get the domain, i  suggest they use multiple drop catching services to improve their chances.  Similar to what you did.  I&#8217;ll definatley be sharing this blog with those who could benefit from your story. Since it would be an obvious conflict of interest, I cannot backorder domains through Godaddy.  In the past I have used Snapnames services and both times they were succesfull. It&#8217;s an amazing feeling when you actually catch the domain and see an email in your inbox congradulating you. Like em so much i&#8217;m using Snapnames again for a recently expired domain, wish me luck :)</p>

			<p>I had a domain registered way back when almost everything was still available, It was a domain that my wife and I simply had pictures of the family the kids and such up for the family members around the country to see and stay in touch. Well we got lazy and accidently let it expire. The Domain was purchased by someone in the middle east that thought they had landed a whopper because the site was hensonkids.com and my Name is Jim Henson. So this guy thinks I&#8217;m the famous rich guy even though he had already died 8 years prior. I contacted him and offered him $ 100 bucks explainig I was just a low paid working guy and it was a site for my family he agreed he would sell it to me for $10K what a jerk well not an exciting ending but he finally got tired and his 5 yrs of reg ran out I finally got it back with a regular reg with go daddy last year. So sometimes if it&#8217;s not a great name and the spammers get tired of waiting you get lucky sometimes</p>

It is registered with Network solutions and I dont have much cash if I backorder with network solutions (if its available) you think that would work for me??</p>

			<p>Not sure it is a brilliant move because of course if your domain is interesting and you call 3 companies to get the name for you. They know now this domain will be free and you can be sure that it is one of the company you called that started to bid on this domain name. They wanted the name to sell it a better price after. Maybe Pool.com raised the price too exactly like peoples do on ebay. If it is a simple nowhere domain name so only Pool.com raised the price. $369 is not a big number so maybe your domain is not so important and you got scammed.</p>
<p>Anyway very very cool and useful informations i got here, thank you.<br />
I got mine for $8.95 after the 75 days. :D</p>

<p>Thanks for the great information. </p>
<p>I was wondering if you could clarify something for me. How does this all change if the domain has already expired? (The domain I&#8217;m interested in expired 2 weeks ago, and register.com has the whois now.)</p>

			<p>The process needs to be legally changed?  Registering companies should<br />
not be able to buy domain names.  They should only be able to<br />
register them for you-period!  A young lawyer, or congressional<br />
representative needs to put these companies in place.  ICANN should<br />
be regulated heavily-they are making a ton.   As far as I know, the<br />
the true price of a website name is $6.42+.20 cents.  This article needs to be completely updated-it&#8217;s way too old-maybe only a few of us care anyway.<br />
Plus-people-put a little thought into a name, or give your money to a good<br />
charity because you are just making a few assholes very rich.  Thanks Mike-</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m just a rookie in this field. It&#8217;s sad to know how this domain business has grown into a huge organized mafia-like syndicate just to obtain a good domain. Gone are the days when you can obtain a good domain name for just the standard $8 or $9+ by simply being the first one to reg it from your registrar (without any middleman deals).</p>
<p>I hope some kind of respectable industry-wide regulation takes over, to even out the playing field and put these greedy sharks out of business.</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t know if anyone has legally challenged any of these companies, but it would seem to me that most have a &#8220;conflict of interests&#8221; going on.  Take for instance Sedo,Moniker,TDNAM-Godaddy and other aftermarket domain sellers or autioners, that also offers Appraisals&#8230;.inevitably they could give you a lowball figure&#8230;all the while  perhaps snatching  it up anonymously at the lowball price and then reselling at a higher price&#8230;this isn&#8217;t unheard of.   Go daddy made me mad when they sneakily offer backorders for $18.95&#8230;.but didn&#8217;t bother to tell you the rules had changed and becaus4e they have varied interests going on, that it now goes to auction first&#8230;..bidding it up&#8230;.Lawyers could have a field day with this&#8230;as I would bet there would be conflict of interests on so many levels&#8230;..</p>

			<p>Hey Mike,</p>
<p>I have a kinda wtf problem with a domain I&#8217;ve been trying to grab for nearly 2 years now.</p>
<p>In August of 07, the domain went into Redemption and exactly one month later, went into PendingDelete. Unfortunately, GoDaddy Backorder failed me (snatched up by some NAME SERVICES jerks) which actually caused me to find your great article.</p>
<p>Here is the wtf-weird part: On 9/16/08, They renewed the domain and the expiration became 9/15/09 from 9/15/08. But on 10/27/08, The status changed to RedemtionPeriod, and the expiration date changed back to 9/15/08. &#8230;. and thats where it has stayed now for 60 days. No changes. What is going on? Is it ever going to delete?</p>

			<p>@Seth &#8211; Having followed many domains, this is a phenomena which I had noticed time and time again.  It looks as if when a domain enters &#8220;expired&#8221; status many registrars show a new expiration date one year into the future, however, this date changes as it enters the &#8220;pending delete&#8221; status.</p>
<p>Looks like your domain should be available any day now&#8230;</p>

			<p>Does anyone know how can you determine the status of a domain name?  How do you know if it&#8217;s in the â€œexpiredâ€, â€œredemption periodâ€, â€œlockedâ€, â€œdropped/availableâ€ status?  The domain I am looking at was set to expire recently and is now set to expire a year later, but I&#8217;m thinking based on some comments that this domain may just be in the &#8220;expired&#8221; state before it goes into the &#8220;redemption period&#8221; state.  Thanks!</p>

			<p>Your best guess would be to monitor the whois information.  If it one of those wired states it should settle sooner or later.  In addition you can visit the site and see what comes up.  If it was renewed in many cases it will show some page.</p>

<p>Question&#8230;.I eyeing a domain that is with Network Solutions and set to expire in Feb 09.  Does SnapNames still have the exclusive with them?  Meaning&#8230;can I put this thing and backorder and probably get it?</p>

Great resource. I&#8217;ve used the services mentioned before and done ok. Got a different question: Have you ever contacted the owner or manager of an expiring domain and offered cash to switch the domain to you and skip this process altogether? I&#8217;d like to know the pros and cons of this method.<br />
Thanks a million-<br />

			<p>David: I&#8217;ve done it and I&#8217;ve had it done to me as well.  Generally (in both cases), the inquirer will make a quick, seemingly casual inquiry, and the inquiree will come back with something like &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not really looking to sell, but make me an offer&#8221;.  At which time, the inquirer says how about &#8220;$100&#8243; and the inquiree says &#8220;actually, it would have to be more like $10,000&#8243;.</p>
<p>That is usually the end of the conversation. :)</p>

			<p>The whole domain process has more flights that one can chew. But it is very discourging for a domain buyer, if he really wants a domain. The regisstrars are acting as domain poachers, and they never allow to fly away all the good dropping domains out of their systems. Only the little domians escape them, and then we fight for those crumbs at auctions. It is foolish and silly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been foolish enough to let a domain name expire and it is now in the redemption period at Tucows.</p>
<p>As it is name specific &#8211; I.E my name followed by &#8220;films&#8221; would that make it less likely Tucows would keep it or auction it?</p>
<p>How can you still grab it during the redemption period as the official previous owner?</p>

			<p>Nearly fours years later and this is still a pretty good article.  Thanks for the read!  I would love an update if possible just to know if the article is still relevant in 2009.</p>
<p>BTW Newsvine.com definitely was  a good choice.  It has a nice ring to it and is easy to remember.  Actually, I had heard of it before ever reading this article, so it was kind of neat to see the inside story.</p>

			<p>I wish I would have found this 5 days ago.  I just watched one hell of a domain name get grabbed by someone else because I signed up with Godaddy.com.  If I would have had any idea I would have signed up with pool.com and would probably be bragging about my catch right now. </p>
<p>thanks for posting the info.<br />

			<p>Dear Mike,</p>
<p>Pool.com keeps being the best, even if the &#8220;2 phase bidding system&#8221; you described was discontinued years ago. Pool.com now uses a standard proxy bidding system, much like the system used by Ebay.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m grateful for this post: without I wouldn&#8217;t know Pool.com and &#8211; probably &#8211; my domain wouldn&#8217;t be mine (for just 60US$)!</p>
<p>Mike, thank you!</p>
<p>Gianni</p>

			<p>Excellent piece on expired domains. I was documenting an article on the topic and came accross this post. And I knew newsvine.com without a clue about the history behind it, which made the things a little intriguing. Many thanks for sharing this information &#8211; will quote you for sure</p>

			<p>Please be careful when you use NamJet. It appears that they share information with Melbourne IT.</p>
<p>I signed up with NameJet to try to get a very, very low value domain name. It is my abbreviated first name and last name plus .com. The site belonged to a defunct Florida mortgage broker two/three years ago and last year it was snapped up by someone else probably because it had some residual traffic (probably).</p>
<p>This November, it was not renewed. I signed up with NameJet in late November and waited and waited. On February 14th, NameJet informed me it was in Pending Delete. Since no-one else was interested in the domain, I just waited some more.</p>
<p>Then on February 24th, Melbourne IT sent me an email asking me for my credit card information in order to secure this domain name. If I wanted it for one year it would be $60 (USD), $95 for two and so on.</p>
<p>Now, the curious part is how they got my contact info and how did they know I wanted this domain name? Just a really educated guess? They just somehow knew I wanted a domain name with my abbreviated first name and last name?</p>
<p>Anyways, I poked around and finally got a phone number for a Melbourne IT outpost in San Francisco and the representative let it slipped that they work with NameJet. When I tried to dig deeper she totally backtracked and tried to say she didn&#8217;t mean that Melbourne IT and NameJet work together.</p>
<p>Well, I know I don&#8217;t have hard evidence that NameJet sold/shared my information and interest in a certain domain name with Melbourne IT but it is too much of a coincidence in my opinion.</p>

			<p>I need to acquire an expiring domain registered through TuCows and I saw that you mentioned that TuCows has or is starting to offer their names to an exclusive auction site. I can&#8217;t find this info on the TuCows site (I can never find ANYTHING I&#8217;m looking for on their site, come to think of it&#8230;). Do you happen know what service they are parterning with?</p>

			<p>Dropped domains are generally not deemed as valuable these days. I just picked up a PR3 dropped domain from digitalpoint forum for $14, even less than the 18.99 back order charge from godaddy. It&#8217;s actually  quite good(phppeixun.com), just you got to be a Chinese to understand the meaning of it.</p>

			<p>Help&#8230;I&#8217;ve got my eye on a domain set to expire 3/16/09.  It&#8217;s registered with GoDaddy.  What does this status info mean?<br />
Status: clientDeleteProhibited<br />
Status: clientRenewProhibited<br />
Status: clientTransferProhibited<br />
Status: clientUpdateProhibited</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming it means the owner isn&#8217;t going to be able to renew the domain??  I also noticed today that the expiration date has changed to 3/16/10.  So what does all this mean?  Has it started into the expire process?  Has GoDaddy taken over?  Is it worth my time to try and get drop company to get the domain for me?</p>

			<p>I believe that message shows up when the domain is locked.  Go daddy provides the control to lock/unlock the domain to the domain owners. It could be a long while before the domain becomes available for registration even if the current owner does not renew.</p>

			<p>Thanks so much for writing this &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to think of a good domain for a new site I am starting &#8211; and about 99% of them are taken&#8230;but NONE of them are actual websites, so that&#8217;s pretty frustrating! I will have to check these out&#8230;four years later from when you originally wrote it so I&#8217;m sure some things are different, but I had no idea these services existed, so it&#8217;s a good place to start :)</p>

			<p>Your page freezes my IE7<br />
It doesnt happen with firefox<br />
Does anyone else have this problem?</p>
<p>Great article, i guess people usually thinks that a domain can be grabbed by someone else the next day after it expires</p>

			<p>Good article very informative. Though I know some domains you can make millions off of if your lucky but I also know you can&#8217;t take register domains that are trademarked already. Say for instance a new chain of stores comes out you can&#8217;t take that store name as a domain name unless you can prove that you had it before they trademarked the name. So alot of it is luck by picking the right domain name to sell later on down the road. But like I said even if your not going to sell it you can&#8217;t take any domain names that are already trademarked.</p>

			<p>Mike Davidson, twas a great article indeed. Very informative and definitely worth telling to my colleagues. Having read this, it reminds me not to procrastinate and always on the lookout of your existing domains.</p>
<p>The internet is surely one dangerous, conniving, diabolical, deceitful, fiendish, and a hell of a playground. Kudos to you for providing this invaluable insight !!</p>

			<p>Mike, thanks for sharing your great story and insight. I have a trademark for a name and I have all several top level domains of the mark, except for the .com. It&#8217;s not being used by the owner (parked page) and the expiration date is coming up in September. I could use the .org version, but i really want the .com. Which service do you think is good these days to grab that domain name? It&#8217;s not registered with network solutions. It looks like snapnames and pool are the best choices. what have you heard lately? Thanks -John</p>

			<p>Ok&#8230; So what about our registars that offer us to BACKORDER a domain name if it&#8217;s not available?   </p>
<p>I backorder all the time&#8230; Sometimes I get the name I want and sometimes I don&#8217;t because the person at last minute pays for another year and it&#8217;s taken off the list again. </p>
<p>BACKORDERING with your registar seems to work for me and I don&#8217;t have to do a auction&#8230; I just pay my $7.00 and it&#8217;s mine! </p>

<p>Depressing, though &#8211; I&#8217;m after a domain name which would be very useful to one of my websites, but I&#8217;m just an amateur &#8211; there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d spend more than $50 on it.  So it sounds like I will just have to forget the whole thing!</p>

			<p>Mike: congrats this gr8  &#8220;ageless&#8221; blog piece and on your M$ success!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now pretty much convinced that buying a ($19) backorder via GoDaddy is pointless for snatching a domain worth of any value that&#8217;s currently on another registrar.<br />
(maybe useful only as notification service)</p>
<p>1. Would this hold true even if the name would be registered with goDaddy? (as they might have 1st dibs to secure it, or does it go back into a PUBLIC ICANN pool)</p>
<p>2. Does anyone know how GoDaddy&#8217;s BackOrder service works in conjunction with TDNAM?</p>
<p>I have unconfirmed reports that GoDaddy is placing expired domains on TDNAM w/o the person who placed the GD BackOrder&#8217;s knowledge (on those particular domains). This appears to be a blatant conflict of interest, as they&#8217;re acting against the the person who paid them for the backorder.</p>

			<p>Following up on #737 and #721, how can we process any of this if the domain is held by the registrar? I have two domains I&#8217;m looking at and they both expired. The client&#8217;s registration that is&#8230; Both domain names hold a &#8220;registrar hold&#8221; until 2010 (one extra year).</p>
<p>What are the chances of a back-ordering system (like NameJet or Pool.com) getting that domain name before 1 year after expiration instead of the 75?</p>
<p>This domain registration business reeks from every pore&#8230; *disgusting*</p>
<p>Great ageless post Mike! :)</p>

			<p>Mike &#8211; First, let me say, thank you for your intelligent write up on your domain drop experience.  Your advice is as relevant 4 years later as the day you first wrote it.  Much respect! </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to share my recent experience in hopes that it is also helpful to others.  In my case the expiring domain I was after was a requirement for a product I will be launching later this year.  Initially, I set up a backorder with Godaddy, but got nervous and backordered with SnapNames and NameJet when I realized that the domain was previously registered at eNom.  Supposedly, NameJet has an exclusive relationship with eNom that gives them some priority when names drop from eNom&#8217;s customers.  Didn&#8217;t seem to matter in my case.   SnapNames picked up the domain for me first.  There was a brief scare when SnapNames emailed me to tell me the domain was going into a 3 day auction and I was the current high bidder.  3 days later, no other bids, and the domain was mine!  So was it worth it?  You bet!  I paid $60 to SnapNames and $20 to Godaddy, no payment to NameJet because they only charge a &#8220;success&#8221; fee.  At the end of the day, I got the domain I had to have, for $80.  No complaints.   I hope this info helps others in similar situations.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, sometimes those harmless-looking, perfectly-named domains may have a checkered past.  Before picking up a domain name that may be banned or blocked due to previously delivering malware, trojans, or porn, you need to do a background check.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve set up a free Domain Background Check cheat sheet at <a href="http://siteriver.com/domaintest.php" rel="nofollow">http://siteriver.com/domaintest.php</a> &#8211; just enter the domain name you are researching and we generate 14 links to domain check, anti-malware, and other tools to quickly check if your domain name is ready for business or is still on parole.</p>

			<p>i  backordered a domain name hosted with Godaddy and lost it 30 seconds before the bidding expired during the grace period.I see also this bidder has something called automatic turned on which i assume outbid me up to a certain $$ amount.No one else up until a few mins before had even bid on the domain name besides myself. No doubt i was upset. Is it worth spending the money with companies like pool, snapnames etc since godaddy is the registrar and it was their bidding so they have control over the release of the domain name aswell?<br />
2.my other option is to contact the current domain holder and offer him extra $$ to buy it if can renew it still?<br />
Thanks&#8230;</p>

			<p>Mike, this is an AMAZING article.</p>
<p>Want to add my 2 cents, that if you&#8217;re looking for a domain drop and it&#8217;s registered at Tucows.com, use NameJet.com, they&#8217;re the official partner for OpenSRS.com, which is Tucow&#8217;s partner registrar.</p>

			<p>Great information! Just as you I&#8217;m looking after some domain name and a bit disappointed that I will not get it in those 6 days left before my desired domain expires :( But at least I do know now what I can do.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

			<p>Looks like NameJet is now the official partner for Network Solutions. And they have upped the minimum bid to $69.<br />
Thanks for the post. Now I will go with Namejet (as opposed to godaddy) since the domain I am after is with Network Solutions.</p>

			<p>Just a quick question for the pro&#8217;s =]</p>
<p>If you cover all bases by back ordering on all of the sites do you not lose money?</p>
<p>By that I mean if I paid them all but say for example pool.com got it for me is there a hidden clause with godaddy and co that means I still have to pay them?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

			<p>That is a good question Jimmy. I am under the impression that once a domain expires then there is a few day period that they wait for renewal. If they dont renew it then I think the domain gets recycled and you can</p>

			<p>don&#8217;t feel like reading through 700+ comments. Did you ever reveal what the domain name was? Either way, what was it????</p>
<p>I was able to get one without going through this whole process&#8230;one day I checked, it wasn&#8217;t available&#8230;was showing as being deleted&#8230;.tried a few days later, and got it&#8230;even used a coupon code&#8230;.maybe i lucked out&#8230;.</p>

			<p>I just ran a little test on a domain name I have tracked for a few years. It was set to expire 10/1/09 so on 9/22/09 I looked up the registrar of record (TUCOWS), went to their site and was led to Afternic for the auction. I looked up the domain listing on Afternic (0 bids active, minimum bid $259, etc). I did NOTHING ELSE. A few days later I checked WHOIS and the domain had been re-registered as of the same day I had made the Afternic query (9/22). </p>
<p>My simple conclusion is that Afternic shares any queries with the domain owner so they can hold on to &#8220;valuable&#8221; property and screw any interested party. Sounds unethical to me.</p>

			<p>The information isn&#8217;t correct. First all companies that domains are registered have different processes. When a domain expires, it really does expire however the domain goes into a redemption period. Most companies offer the current owner the first opportunity to REDEEM it. Usually the first 20 or so days are for only the normal renewal cost, after that, there is an additional fee applied. Backorders never guarantee someone a domain.</p>

			<p>Hi Mike.</p>
<p>I was really thrilled to read your post. It was quite enjoyable. </p>
<p>Actually I was searching for &#8220;How to snatch a registered domain&#8221; and I ended up here. The domain I am looking for is expiring next week. And I am seriously looking forward to grab it.</p>
<p>The article was quite informative as well as entertaining. I will surely put a link to this post in  my website.</p>
<p>But one thing, me and most of other user will surely want to know what was the domain name, which created such a tense environment. Please do post the website when it is ready.</p>
<p>Once again, the article is really great.</p>

			<p>First of all, excellent article. Second of all, newsvine.com, good domain name and it&#8217;s crazy to think that (at least according to the footer), Newsvine has been running since 2005 now and you never told us!</p>
<p>The question I think we are all thinking in our heads as we read this however is: is it worth it? Is it worth it for us to spend that much money and go through all that trouble to get the domain name we want? For some people, the answer is clear and simple,  mostly because their domain name is probably very popular or very valuable&#8230; or both. For others, like me, it really makes me think:</p>
<p>- Do I really want this domain name?<br />
- How much am I willing to spend to get it?<br />
- If I don&#8217;t get it, will I be satisfied with some alternate domain name that&#8217;s similar to the one I want?</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be nice if you could&#8217;ve given your thoughts about these issues and how this info can help or apply to us; as well as which company we should choose out of the three you mentioned, if we only want to invest in one.</p>
<p>It would also be nice if you explained more about GoDaddy&#8217;s backorders, what they really are and how they work. Would they really help you, with a not super popular domain name at least? What do they do? </p>
<p>And one last question arises in my mind: can you get an expired domain name without backorders or any professional companies working for you? If it&#8217;s not a very popular domain name, but it has been taken before and is set to expire, is it possible for someone to get it without any of that, simply by checking every day if it is available?</p>
<p>Thanks for the article!</p>
<p>~Dmytro</p>
<p>P.S. It seems one of your links has expired. The link to &#8220;my hosting company of choice&#8221;, which links to &#8220;http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/dreamhost-web-hosting&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work, and I would like to read more about a hosting company that you think is good.</p>

<p>A simple Google or Wikipedia search for Newsvine should tell you the answer to that question.  I am not a domain speculator.  I got newsvine.com so I could build a business around it.  It was the best $369 I&#8217;ve ever spent.</p>

			<p>In reply to *your* reply to Sshaggy, we are missing the second update because it&#8217;s not very noticeable and because you updated it very recently! I viewed this article three days ago and the update was not there &#8211; had I not come back for a second read, I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed. In fact, I almost missed it, because I planned on being lazy and not reading through Update #1. Plus, your second update is too close to the comments, and most people don&#8217;t want to read other people&#8217;s comments, they just scroll down to the very bottom to post their own.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we miss it. :D Okay, but now that we now about the domain name and I went there and saw Newsvine, I&#8217;m amazed. I think I might&#8217;ve heard of it sometimes, but I never knew it was there and it looks fun and awesome. Did you built it all by yourself? Because it says it&#8217;s owned my MSNBC. Why didn&#8217;t you write any posts about it? Why was this all so secretive?</p>

Again, I recommend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsvine" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=newsvine+acquired&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">Google</a> for anything you may be curious about. There is nothing secretive here.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s been there for two years? Well.. wow! I&#8217;m sorry then, I must&#8217;ve missed it the first time I read this article &#8211; and that just proves my point about how unnoticable it is. Perhaps put it up at the top, or even better, edit your whole blog post and replace &#8220;the domain name I wanted&#8221; with &#8220;newsvine.com&#8221;?</p>
<p>I am quite big on reading and research to tell you the truth, but I don&#8217;t want to argue, so I&#8217;ll just say: I did go to Wikipedia and searched up Newsvine. That&#8217;s why I said in my first comment here &#8220;Newsvine has been running since 2005 now and you never told us!&#8221;. </p>
<p>All I meant about secretive was not finding a blog post about Newsvine *here* on this blog &#8211; and in that case, you might be right, Isince  did not scour this blog for articles about Newsvine, so you might&#8217;ve actually mentioned it. My mistake. Sorry!</p>

			<p>&#8220;A simple Google or Wikipedia search for Newsvine should tell you the answer to that question. I am not a domain speculator. I got newsvine.com so I could build a business around it. It was the best $369 I’ve ever spent.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if you didn&#8217;t get that domain name, you could&#8217;ve surely chosen another name for Newsvine and made the same profit and the same successful business, no?</p>
<p>All right then, which service do you recommend me using if I&#8217;m serious about getting the domain name, but not serious enough to register with all three? Pool.com definitely sounds like the best one according to your blog post, but I also have to agree with your suspicions &#8211; that the company might be secretly bidding themselves to get the domain or that the other bidder who was bidding against you might not have been a real person at all&#8230;</p>

			<p>Dear Mike</p>
<p>I read the article quite casually. But I didn&#8217;t find the domain name. Also I read a few first comments, where people were asking you for the domain name. So I safely assumed that u haven&#8217;t yet disclosed it. Anyways, Newsvine is quite worth of $369.</p>

			<p>I read your story with the greatest of interest, not because I knew of you or Newsvine, but because I am going to purchase a domain for the first time and the one I would like is beginning to expire.  Excellent write-up, even though the information may now be a bit dated.  The lesson here, however, is that any of us with these questions can still educate ourselves on the current process just as you did, and that good things can come from sticking with a dream and doing the work and research to make it happen.  I visited your site Newsvine.com and immediately noticed the MSNBC logo at the bottom, so I figure you made out pretty well with your $369.  Congratulations, and thank you for the information and the story.</p>

			<p>Great article, thank you.  There&#8217;s a domain I&#8217;m hoping to grab, and some of these services seem sketchy.  Learning more about how they work goes a long way towards making me feel better about entering credit card information, making a bid, covering my eyes and hoping it works out.</p>

			<p>Even though its been some time since the original post, it was still an interesting read. I hope you&#8217;ve remembered to renew it after so long. :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking at an expiring domain at the moment, while I wouldn&#8217;t mind paying a couple of hundred for it, after doing a keyword search, I feel it could easily triple that.</p>
<p>I reckon I&#8217;ll give my fingers some exercise and click refresh every minute or two.</p>

<p>Dmytro: No, it doesn&#8217;t really prove anything besides the fact that you skim blog entries, don&#8217;t read the details, and then jump to all sorts of conclusions. In case you haven&#8217;t realized it yet, I don&#8217;t particularly care what you get out of this blog entry or anything else around here. Those who are interested in reading complete articles will get complete information&#8230; those are aren&#8217;t, will get something less.  And I&#8217;m totally fine with that.</p>

			<p>Hello Mike,<br />
Your article was great and the feedback from everyone is very informative. Can you tell me how and if this process differs with a domain registered with the registrar being in Sweden called and located at:</p>
<p>Loopia Webbhotell AB, Loopia Registry<br />
Country SE</p>
<p>Looking Forward to a response!<br />
Thank You!!</p>

<p>We were all suspicious this was happening and it turns out we were right. This guy bid on the one snapnames auction I was in on.</p>
<p>ICANN are on the take one way or another. They make their money from registrars. You can&#8217;t ask wolves to provide security for us sheep.</p>

			<p>This was a huge help, thanks. I&#8217;m about to go for an expiring domain that&#8217;s a friends legal name so hopefully it won&#8217;t go into the auction phase since it&#8217;s pretty unique. I might go with Godaddy and take the chance. It just bugs me that snap doesn&#8217;t provide any transparency like the identity of the other bidders, wow that&#8217;s suspicious&#8230;</p>

			<p>Thanks for sharing this treasure trove of information with us. It has given me a real insight into expiring domains and how the whole process works.</p>
<p>The domain name business really needs some renovation with expiring domains. The Verisign idea sounds good, maybe better if for example objections could be put in place so that Tucows et al don&#8217;t reserve a load of expiring domains for the sake of it.</p>

			<p>Thanks for posting this. </p>
<p>I found your page while trying to develop a strategy to purchase domain name that is currently in &#8216;expired&#8217; status. After doing some reading here, I researched the domain and discovered that registrar is known as a &#8216;spam house&#8217; that has been linked to at least one sign up scam for adult sites. </p>
<p>I won&#8217;t be bidding on the name. Even if I was successful, the URL has probably been banned or flagged by every SE on the planet.</p>
<p>By the way, for fun you might want to Google the registrar&#8217;s address &#8220;PMB 368, 14150 NE 20th St &#8211; F1&#8243;</p>

			<p>What companies like enom and snapnames should do to lift out these suspicions about shill bidding (which I do think are very concerning and legitimate concerns) would be to let you put the maximum bid price you&#8217;re willing to pay when placing your backorder.  The service cost $60, you should have an option to say &#8220;I&#8217;ll pay $60 if you manage to catch the domain and I won&#8217;t participate in any bidding war, I&#8217;ll pay $60 and that&#8217;s it&#8221;.  That would lift the suspicions of &#8220;shill bidders&#8221;: you make your intent clear from the start if there&#8217;s only *one* other bidder you won&#8217;t buy the domain.</p>

			<p>Hi Mike,<br />
Nice to post on a site without having to register<br />

<p>I had to say It is Really amazing how your story and<br />
experience from 5 years ago is still going strong.</p>
<p>You go.. All I did was type in search reference to<br />
backordering domains success rate of? </p>
<p>Thanks for your information very helpful.<br />

			<p>great article, mike!  it really helped a lot to demystify what exactly the &#8220;90 day waiting period&#8221; was when i asked godaddy if i could purchase an expired domain name.  </p>
<p>in case anyone else is thinking of doing a backorder with godaddy, you actually have to purchase the backorder first and then type in the domain name you want.  seems a bit backwards to me and another way of making $$ but whatever, i hope it works.</p>
<p>happy buying!</p>

			<p>Thanks for telling us. I was thinking I can easy buy expired domains by myself, but thanks to you now I have a better idea on how to act in such situations. +10</p>
<p>PS: I see you wrote the article in 2005. Did you sell the domain to msnbc?</p>

You showed up first and looks like I don&#8217;t need to read any further. Thanks for such a comprehensive article, you cleared up so many things.

			<p>What makes you say newsvine.com is a valuable domain? Can you please elaborate? I know you said it&#8217;s valuable to you. Did it have good pagerank from day one? Or is there some TV/sports reference (I follow neither) that I don&#8217;t get? (didn&#8217;t get the A-Rod reference and have never heard of Scott Boras). I mean it&#8217;s not valuable like insurance.com or sex.com, right?</p>

			<p>Thanks so much for this article, it&#8217;s very informative.</p>
<p>Can anyone who&#8217;s used these services give some insight as to what type of personal information is required upfront to use these the? Do you have to give your credit card info upfront, or name or address, etc.  I&#8217;m always hesitant to give info to a company with whom I&#8217;m not certain I will be transacting business.</p>

			<p>Great story and very educational!</p>
<p>I am only glad you got your domain after so much effort. </p>
<p>Just a quick question. If the domain name I am after is registered to Enom.com, should I then engage in a Backorder with themselves? </p>
<p>It seems odd I&#8217;ll have to bid to compete with Enom. Their website took me to a backorder provider called NameJet. I supposed they are related somehow? </p>
<p>Any advise would be fab. Look forward to hearing from you.</p>

I am whetting my feet in this domain catching process. Couple of years back the only net i used was godaddy, it&#8217;s has lots of holes in it. Godaddy, is a waste and made me loose on the domains i really wanted. Now i got many others nets to catch those trophies. Today, I did a test and succeeded, although, it was not a hot domain. Great Help. Great Post.</p>

			<p>Fascinating article. So fascinating people like myself are still commenting. Now that it&#8217;s years later, I was wondering if anyone knew how the process might have changed now that it&#8217;s 2010. </p>

			<p>This is a very interesting article on both the domain expiry process as well as back-ordering.<br />
It looks like all the big guys of domain trade resort all kind of tactics.  </p>
<p>In my country India, domain resellers generally register customer&#8217;s domain in their own name so that they can force the customer to buy hosting &amp; other services alongwith domain renewals.  Many times these smalltime resellers shut shop and the customer cant renew the domain and sometimes loses it.  I have been raising this issue on various platforms but unfortunately unable to get any success apart from verisign rep in India assuring that this is a important issue and customers need to be educated about it.</p>

<p>Like so many others I also researched how to grab a domain and I came across your story. Very well written and very informative. I finally decided on a first step that is so obvious that I&#8217;m surprised it isn&#8217;t everyone&#8217;s first step. I checked the whois database and e-mailed the administrative contact. Got a reply very soon and we settled the whole matter within days for a very reasonable price. No stress, no waiting. And the transfer to &#8211; in my case &#8211; GoDaddy was pretty smooth. One glitch occurred but the GoDaddy reps were very knowledgeable and able to make the whole experience a good one.<br />
You did grab yourself a great domain name though&#8230; Congrats!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Albert.</p>

			<p>Great article, but you forgot to mention one of the main players in domain &#8220;drop catching&#8221;, NameJet. I have purchased many names from NameJet, and from Snap Names, but stoped buying from Snap Names after one of their executives (Halvarez)was found to be bidding on names to get the sales price higher, I actually won a bid against him</p>

			<p>I certainly hope there&#8217;s an update to this as 2005 is certainly long long ago. The post is very enlightening especially since it gave specific numbers ,e.g. 75 days. How would we mere mortals know about these details?</p>
<p>My particular interest is in acquiring some 3-letter domains. Is it still possible in this day and age? the shortest I&#8217;ve gotten so far is a 4-letter .net domain.</p>

			<p>Thats a good domain. There are a copuple over the years I have been interested in. Waiting the allotted time is like sitting on pins and needles. I tried backorder once years ago, something fish.com and someone else got it. The website though, kept my money. Was not impressed.</p>
<p>Because Pool said you had only one bidder, I wonder what other people&#8217;s experiences are. Has anyone never had another bidder? With the 1000&#8242;s that use Pool, it could be possible that they have the systems in place to flag potentially valuable domains, which someone verifies and phantom bidders are determined. Could turn a million dollar company into a billion dollar one. For this reason, I am leary as what kind of audit system do these websites have?</p>

			<p>@Micahel Sosnowski. I have used Namecheap for .com and domains.ca for Canada (I am Canadian). I originally, many years ago used Network Solutions until the cheap wave of registrars came out. Then it was GoDaddy. However in 2003 they hijacked one of my domains, prozilla.com, because they had spam complaints. Without a warning they wanted $100 to reinstate the account. I just put in a transfer from Namecheap and got it moved fr $8.88 and never used GoDaddy again. On top of that, I changed my websites suggestions of using GoDaddy to Namecheap for my members. Since Prozilla sells turnkey websites, it was 1000&#8242;s of customers GoDaddy lost. </p>
<p>How GoDaddy came to suspend my account was because I had an affiliate program and an affiliate (s) had sent emails to promote my program. GoDaddy never gave any warnings and never did give me any information so I could find out who the spammer in my program was. I have 100+ domains from Namecheap and have never had a problem.</p>

			<p>This is a great read ever about catch on an expiring domain.  Luckily is still updating until 2010 from 2005.  I am going to snap one expiring domain for my friend.  This domain is non popular and specific for certain country.  I am considering between Snapnames.com and Enom.com.  Since I have no expriences with backorder, who is the best between them for now?  I am also considering Pool.com but from what I have read your post, it does look like shadey in auction and I do really hates it.</p>
<p>Apart from this &#8211; I do agree with Airdrie Painters about Namecheap.  Except they are not offering any backorder domain service, they are the best domain register services I have ever used.  I have use Godaddy without any problem actually but my friend has.  That&#8217;s why I never purchase my important domain via Godaddy.</p>

			<p>Thanks Mike. This is a great post. I learned a lot and think you&#8217;ve provided a tremendous resource for all of trying to figure out how we might get those domains we want that are about to expire.<br />
Keep up the great work.</p>

			<p>Truly that was very informative. Too bad I read this a little too late. I was not able to manually bid for a certain domain name once it was dropped becasue it was automatically snatched up by the bigger guys. </p>
<p>This led to continuous frustration, but I did end up coming across Pool.com which I then decided to try, but this time I would pay the $60 to secure <a href="http://www.hermitcrabworld.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hermitcrabworld.com</a> for my hobby site. I know this website might not seem like much but I bought it because I thought I would acquire the Page Rank and the domain age of the site.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this made a difference at all&#8230;becasue once the domain name legally mine, the page rank dropped and the age of the domain reset. </p>
<p>Please shed some light on this topic! Is there any way to save the PR of the website when it is in the Deletion process?</p>
<p>Thank you in advanced.<br />
PS. Great Info!</p>

			<p>I was able to get my domain research401krollover.com off Snapnames.com for a good price too! ENOM.com doesn&#8217;t let you search for old expiring domains by keyword type, so it&#8217;s not really useful. And wow Pool.com says 76,196 Domains Deleting Today, definitely have to look at this one! </p>

<p>would it be best to place the back order after the domain’s status reads &#8220;locked&#8221; and right at the last moment of the 5 day period between 11am and 2pm pacific time?</p>

			<p>Wow &#8211; I just totally got scammed there&#8230;</p>
<p>I just &#8216;won&#8217; an auction on NameJet (enom), with 1 bid as the ONLY bidder, and the damn thing jumped straight for my max bid!</p>
<p>Since when does an online auction &#8216;bid&#8217; all the way up to your max bid when there is no reserve and no other bids?! This is a total scam. I have sent them a ticket, but as they bill your CC straigt away, I have a feeling I&#8217;m not going to get very far with this.</p>
<p>Be exceedingly careful here &#8211; services for domainers seem to be as much a group of cut-throat unethical theives as most domainers are themselves!</p>
<p>What a bunch of bastard. Will update if/when they reply to my ticket&#8230;</p>

			<p>great info thanks. If you are looking for random quality domains, you can also try <a href="http://ValueDrops.com" rel="nofollow">http://ValueDrops.com</a>, it filters and displays the quality dropping domains. You can even hand register many of them, so for those who don&#8217;t want to pay extra, this may be an alternative.</p>

Sedo.com,<br />
Godaddy.com,<br />
Snapnames.com,<br />
and one other one.<br />
They are all different and some overlap.</p>
<p>I liked it when they were more competitive for the minimum bids.</p>

			<p>Great post &#8211; 5yrs old and still getting comments! I didn&#8217;t know how the expiring domain thing worked and this has informed me quite well. From what I can tell not much has changed in the process.  </p>
<p>A domain name I become interested in is currently in the Redemption period and its already controlled by ENOM. I think from what I&#8217;ve learned now I&#8217;ll take the wait and see approach and not play this bidding game. </p>
<p>Understanding that I&#8217;ll most likely be needing to come up with a new name..which is important but I&#8217;m sure newsvine.com sold because of its content.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

			<p>David: Yeah, it&#8217;s funny reading comments from some of these domain hucksters who think I sold the newsvine.com *domain* to msnbc.com and how cool that is. The domain is just a small part of the company and the product.</p>

			<p>Just a follow up. The domain name I was interested went out of REDEMPTION PERIOD around 6/28 and then into its PENDING DELETE period of 5 days. Checking each day and when I checked on 7/4 it was&#8230;.available! Now registered to me &#8211; Yay! \@_@/</p>
<p>Hmmmm&#8230;now about that content&#8230;.</p>

			<p>Thought I&#8217;d let you all know a strange thing about NameJet. To get my domain I registered with SnapNames, Pool &amp; NameJet. </p>
<p>During the deletion period, NameJet had my domain-to-be listed as &#8220;Pending Deletion&#8221; and showed another bidder besides me. The domain was originally registered by one of the registrars that NameJet claims they have a special relationship with and therefore get first grabs at it.</p>
<p>The way they list the domain on their website makes you think the domain is in the bidding stage &#8230; in other words, to make you think that NameJet has already succeeded in getting the domain and that there are other bidders. I think this is to encourage you to increase your bid. In the event they are able to snatch it, you&#8217;ll end up paying more. </p>
<p>But in my case SnapNames got the domain despite NameJet&#8217;s supposedly special relationship with the registrar. And SnapNames got it for me at the cheapest price of all three services and with no auction to boot! Nice.</p>

			<p>Hi Mike. Your article continues to get some good traffic. I&#8217;ve actually made it suggested reading to my university students in entrepreneurship. It&#8217;s possible that you have answered this indirectly already, but what about host sites like Tierranet aka DomainDisoverer and others who buy up names. Are they allowed to do this if the site is not actually used or active? Must one negotiate directly with them?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Mary</p>

			<p>Awesome article. I always wondered how the process works for buying expiring or expired domains. Never knew it was such a war. lol.<br />
Idk why but I laughed when I read the stuff about Pool and them crawling the servers during that 2 hour period.</p>

			<p>Nice Post! 5 years old and still relevant info for newcomers. I have a tip for everyone who is looking for expired .de domains. There are some site out there that find these, but most of them are slow or you have to pay&#8230; On <a href="http://www.peew.de" rel="nofollow">http://www.peew.de</a> you get it all for nothing! It&#8217;s in german, but the navigation is in english, so you should find what you are looking for.</p>

			<p>Great article, even years later. In fact probably better because I didn&#8217;t have to wait to find out the name of the domain, as well as being able to head over to wikipedia and learn about the success you guys turned newsvine into after you picked it up.</p>
<p>Exciting and frustrating at the same time.<br />
Sitting on the edge of my seat for that 6 minute section of the article LOL!</p>

			<p>This article is 100% helpful in backordering domains. I backordered through namejet, snapnames and pool. Two of the sites had multiple people backordering. Luckily snapnames only had me and two other people who all bid minimum amount. I got the domain for $59 and what&#8217;s even better we are a brand new business and the domain we got is the name of our business which today is extremely hard to do.<br />
THANK FOR THE POSTING. YOU ARE THE MAN!!!!</p>

			<p>Some people have been posting about losing their domains because they forgot to re-register. What about people dying? What about guys who have spent most of their lives building successful sites worth alot of money who suddenly die? If someone has a domain name that they value, they should register it for 100 years if possible and leave it in their will to their loved ones. That way the third party domain broker has no chance of taking away someone&#8217;s livelihood. Maybe setting up a website to offer these kinds of services would be good. I personally need to make records of all the websites I own and let someone else what I am doing and what kind of money I am making before my own demise as well. At least then, all the effort , late hours and such can benefit someone else.</p>

			<p>100 years?!?!?  For one I don&#8217;t think you could register it that long.  And even for just the name, that would cost bare minimum $2000.  Not including hosting.  Sure, if you were Microsoft and you had the money to burn.  But for the average domain owner, no way they could afford that.  I can&#8217;t afford that, that&#8217;s for sure!</p>

			<p>wouldn&#8217;t it be fuckin awesome if we could ditch this silly domain name system.. god, it&#8217;s so oppressive and shadowy.  The money you have to fart out and the seedy characters you are forced to deal with for the REALLY good domain names.. forget about it, yknow?</p>
<p>People that think the cool one they&#8217;re waiting out with a country code won&#8217;t be contested are fooling themselves.. if you&#8217;re looking at it, 10 other jokers just like you have been, too.  That&#8217;s gonna happen to me come about February-March.  I&#8217;m gonna be fuckin-A pissed when I cheap out and fail to get the domain I&#8217;ve been staring at.. but what ev.. certainly not paying some service(s) hundreds of dollars to fuck around with some web of scammers and middlemen.</p>

			<p>Hi, I&#8217;m trying to buy a domain name that I used to own but sold to the person who bought my business a few years ago.  Somehow my personal email was left on the registration account and I am CC&#8217;ed the domain renewal notices (so, I got a head&#8217;s up that they were failing to renew and that the domain was expiring). </p>
<p>For several months the new business/domain owner failed to pay and the website was removed and parked.  I asked the domain owner if she were interested in selling but she refused my offers. Then the domain expired and I found it listed at Snap Names with zero bids and a few days remaining. </p>
<p>I read this article and decided to just wait it out.  I&#8217;ve made no bids and no back order.  It&#8217;s not a great domain name but has a great amount of value to me.  I want it but I doubt anyone else would.  </p>
<p>Anyway, the domain was listed at Snap Names but the &#8220;bid by&#8221; date has recently disappeared.  The only option now is to place a back order.  </p>
<p>Would it be best to just wait this out?  Will it become available eventually?  I&#8217;ve never bought a domain this way and it&#8217;s very daunting.  Any advise would be hugely appreciated.  Thanks!</p>

<p>A thoughtful, but ultimately overcomplicated look at why Pearl Jam’s career arc peaked so early but has lasted so long. The simpler truth is that a lot of rock music — particularly grunge — arises not just <em>from</em> youthful adversity but <em>because</em> of it. When the hunger and adversity are gone (because you’re successful and popular), the inspiration and even ability to write that sort of music tends to disappear with it.</p>
<p>It’s also unbelievable to me that the author of this piece has not seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105415/">Singles</a>. Aside from it being one of my top 5 movies of all time, I would think any lover of the early ’90s alt music scene would see it just because it exists.
