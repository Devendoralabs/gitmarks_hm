<P><I>From the preface:</I>
<P>This book is both an introductory textbook and a research monograph on
modelling the statistical structure of natural images.  In very simple
terms, ``natural images'' are photographs of the typical environment
where we live.  In this book, their statistical structure is described
using a number of statistical models whose parameters are estimated
from image samples.</P>

<P>Our main motivation for exploring natural image statistics is
computational modelling of biological visual systems.  A theoretical
framework which is gaining more and more support considers the
properties of the visual system to be reflections of the statistical
structure of natural images, because of evolutionary adaptation
processes.  Another motivation for natural image statistics research
is in computer science and engineering, where it helps in development
of better image processing and computer vision methods.</P>


<P>The book is targeted for advanced undergraduate students, graduate
students and researchers in vision science, computational
neuroscience, computer vision and image processing. It can also be
read as an introduction to the area by people with a background in
mathematical disciplines (mathematics, statistics, theoretical
physics).
Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the subject, the book has been
written so as to be accessible to an audience coming from very
different backgrounds such as psychology, computer science, electrical
engineering, neurobiology, mathematics, statistics and
physics.
