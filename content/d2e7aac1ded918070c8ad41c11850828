<span class="dropcaps-1">I</span>&#8216;m sipping a scummy pint of cloudy beer in the back of a trendy dive bar turned nightclub in the heart of the city&#8217;s heroin district. In front of me stand a gang of hippiesh grunge-punk types, who crowd around each other and collectively scoff at the smoking laws by sneaking puffs of &quot;fuck-you,&quot; reveling in their perceived rebellion as the haggard, staggering staff look on without the slightest&nbsp;concern. 
</p>
<p>
The &quot;DJ&quot; is keystroking a selection of MP3s off his MacBook, making a mix that sounds like he took a hatchet to a collection of yesteryear billboard hits, from DMX to Dolly Parton, but mashed up with a jittery techno&nbsp;backbeat. 
</p>
<p>
&quot;So&#8230; this is a hipster party?&quot; I ask the girl sitting next to me. She&#8217;s wearing big dangling earrings, an American Apparel V-neck tee, non-prescription eyeglasses and an inappropriately warm wool&nbsp;coat. 
</p>
<p>
&quot;Yeah, just look around you, 99 percent of the people here are total&nbsp;hipsters!&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Are you a&nbsp;hipster?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Fuck no,&quot; she says, laughing back the last of her glass before she hops off to the dance&nbsp;floor.
</p>
<p>
Ever since the Allies bombed the Axis into submission, Western civilization has had a succession of counter-culture movements that have energetically challenged the status quo. Each successive decade of the post-war era has seen it smash social standards, riot and fight to revolutionize every aspect of music, art, government and civil&nbsp;society.
</p>
<p>
But after punk was plasticized and hip hop lost its impetus for social change, all of the formerly dominant streams of &quot;counter-culture&quot; have merged together. Now, one mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior has come to define the generally indefinable idea of the&nbsp;&quot;Hipster.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
An artificial appropriation of different styles from different eras, the hipster represents the end of Western civilization – a culture lost in the superficiality of its past and unable to create any new meaning. Not only is it unsustainable, it is suicidal. While previous youth movements have challenged the dysfunction and decadence of their elders, today we have the &quot;hipster&quot; – a youth subculture that mirrors the doomed shallowness of mainstream&nbsp;society.

<span class="dropcaps-2">T</span>ake a stroll down the street in any major North American or European city and you&#8217;ll be sure to see a speckle of fashion-conscious twentysomethings hanging about and sporting a number of predictable stylistic trademarks: skinny jeans, cotton spandex leggings, fixed-gear bikes, vintage flannel, fake eyeglasses and a keffiyeh – initially sported by Jewish students and Western protesters to express solidarity with Palestinians, the keffiyeh has become a completely meaningless hipster cliché fashion&nbsp;accessory. 
</p>
<p>
The American Apparel V-neck shirt, Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and Parliament cigarettes are symbols and icons of working or revolutionary classes that have been appropriated by hipsterdom and drained of meaning. Ten years ago, a man wearing a plain V-neck tee and drinking a Pabst would never be accused of being a trend-follower. But in 2008, such things have become shameless clichés of a class of individuals that seek to escape their own wealth and privilege by immersing themselves in the aesthetic of the working&nbsp;class.

<p>
This obsession with &quot;street-cred&quot; reaches its apex of absurdity as hipsters have recently and wholeheartedly adopted the fixed-gear bike as the only acceptable form of transportation – only to have brakes installed on a piece of machinery that is defined by its lack&nbsp;thereof. 
</p>
<p>
Lovers of apathy and irony, hipsters are connected through a global network of blogs and shops that push forth a global vision of fashion-informed aesthetics. Loosely associated with some form of creative output, they attend art parties, take lo-fi pictures with analog cameras, ride their bikes to night clubs and sweat it up at nouveau disco-coke parties. The hipster tends to religiously blog about their daily exploits, usually while leafing through generation-defining magazines like <i>Vice</i>, <i>Another Magazine</i> and <i>Wallpaper</i>. This cursory and stylized lifestyle has made the hipster almost universally&nbsp;loathed. 
</p>
<p>
&quot;These hipster zombies… are the idols of the style pages, the darlings of viral marketers and the marks of predatory real-estate agents,&quot; wrote Christian Lorentzen in a <i>Time Out New York</i> article entitled ‘Why the Hipster Must Die.&#8217; &quot;And they must be buried for cool to be&nbsp;reborn.&quot;

<div class="column span-15 prepend-1">

<p>
With nothing to defend, uphold or even embrace, the idea of &quot;hipsterdom&quot; is left wide open for attack. And yet, it is this ironic lack of authenticity that has allowed hipsterdom to grow into a global phenomenon that is set to consume the very core of Western counterculture. Most critics make a point of attacking the hipster&#8217;s lack of individuality, but it is this stubborn obfuscation that distinguishes them from their predecessors, while allowing hipsterdom to easily blend in and mutate other social movements, sub-cultures and&nbsp;lifestyles.

<p>
Standing outside an art-party next to a neat row of locked-up fixed-gear bikes, I come across a couple girls who exemplify hipster homogeneity. I ask one of the girls if her being at an art party and wearing fake eyeglasses, leggings and a flannel shirt makes her a&nbsp;hipster.
</p>
<p>
&quot;I&#8217;m not comfortable with that term,&quot; she&nbsp;replies.

Gavin McInnes, one of the founders of <i>Vice</i>, who recently left the magazine, is considered to be one of hipsterdom&#8217;s primary architects. But, in contrast to the majority of concerned media-types, McInnes, whose &quot;Dos and Don&#8217;ts&quot; commentary defined the rules of hipster fashion for over a decade, is more critical of those doing the&nbsp;criticizing.
</p>
<p>
&quot;I&#8217;ve always found that word [&quot;hipster&quot;] is used with such disdain, like it&#8217;s always used by chubby bloggers who aren&#8217;t getting laid anymore and are bored, and they&#8217;re just so mad at these young kids for going out and getting wasted and having fun and being fashionable,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#8217;m dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an&nbsp;agenda.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Punks wear their tattered threads and studded leather jackets with honor, priding themselves on their innovative and cheap methods of self-expression and rebellion. B-boys and b-girls announce themselves to anyone within earshot with baggy gear and boomboxes. But it is rare, if not impossible, to find an individual who will proclaim themself a proud hipster. It&#8217;s an odd dance of self-identity – adamantly denying your existence while wearing clearly defined symbols that proclaims&nbsp;it.

&quot;He&#8217;s 17 and he lives for the scene!&quot; a girl whispers in my ear as I sneak a photo of a young kid dancing up against a wall in a dimly lit corner of the after-party. He&#8217;s got a flipped-out, do-it-yourself haircut, skin-tight jeans, leather jacket, a vintage punk tee and some popping high&nbsp;tops. 
</p>
<p>
&quot;Shoot me,&quot; he demands, walking up, cigarette in mouth, striking a pose and exhaling. He hits a few different angles with a firmly unimpressed expression and then gets a bit giddy when I show him the&nbsp;results.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Rad, thanks,&quot; he says, re-focusing on the music and submerging himself back into the sweaty funk of the crowd where he resumes a jittery head bobble with a little bit of a&nbsp;twitch. 
</p>
<p>
The dance floor at a hipster party looks like it should be surrounded by quotation marks. While punk, disco and hip hop all had immersive, intimate and energetic dance styles that liberated the dancer from his/her mental states – be it the head-spinning b-boy or violent thrashings of a live punk show – the hipster has more of a joke dance. A faux shrug shuffle that mocks the very idea of dancing or, at its best, illustrates a non-committal fear of expression typified in a weird twitch/ironic twist. The dancers are too self-aware to let themselves feel any form of liberation; they shuffle along, shrugging themselves into&nbsp;oblivion.

<span class="dropcaps-2">P</span>erhaps the true motivation behind this deliberate nonchalance is an attempt to attract the attention of the ever-present party photographers, who swim through the crowd like neon sharks, flashing little blasts of phosphorescent ecstasy whenever they spot someone worth momentarily&nbsp;immortalizing. 
</p>
<p>
Noticing a few flickers of light splash out from the club bathroom, I peep in only to find one such photographer taking part in an impromptu soft-core porno shoot. Two girls and a guy are taking off their clothes and striking poses for a set of grimy glamour shots. It&#8217;s all grins and smirks until another girl pokes her head inside and screeches, &quot;You&#8217;re not some club kid in New York in the nineties. This shit is so hipster!&quot; – which sparks a bit of a catfight, causing me to beat a hasty&nbsp;retreat. 
</p>
<p>
In many ways, the lifestyle promoted by hipsterdom is highly ritualized. Many of the party-goers who are subject to the photoblogger&#8217;s snapshots no doubt crawl out of bed the next afternoon and immediately re-experience the previous night&#8217;s debauchery. Red-eyed and bleary, they sit hunched over their laptops, wading through a sea of similarity to find their own (momentarily) thrilling instant of perfected&nbsp;hipster-ness. 
</p>
<p>
What they may or may not know is that &quot;cool-hunters&quot; will also be skulking the same sites, taking note of how they dress and what they consume. These marketers and party-promoters get paid to co-opt youth culture and then re-sell it back at a profit. In the end, hipsters are sold what they think they invent and are spoon-fed their pre-packaged cultural&nbsp;livelihood.
</p>
<p>
Hipsterdom is the first &quot;counterculture&quot; to be born under the advertising industry&#8217;s microscope, leaving it open to constant manipulation but also forcing its participants to continually shift their interests and affiliations. Less a subculture, the hipster is a consumer group – using their capital to purchase empty authenticity and rebellion. But the moment a trend, band, sound, style or feeling gains too much exposure, it is suddenly looked upon with disdain. Hipsters cannot afford to maintain any cultural loyalties or affiliations for fear they will lose&nbsp;relevance.
</p>
<p>
An amalgamation of its own history, the youth of the West are left with consuming cool rather that creating it. The cultural zeitgeists of the past have always been sparked by furious indignation and are reactionary movements. But the hipster&#8217;s self-involved and isolated maintenance does nothing to feed cultural evolution. Western civilization&#8217;s well has run dry. The only way to avoid hitting the colossus of societal failure that looms over the horizon is for the kids to abandon this vain existence and start&nbsp;over.

&quot;If you don&#8217;t give a damn, we don&#8217;t give a fuck!&quot; chants an emcee before his incitements are abruptly cut short when the power plug is pulled and the lights snapped&nbsp;on.
</p>
<p>
Dawn breaks and the last of the after-after-parties begin to spill into the streets. The hipsters are falling out, rubbing their eyes and scanning the surrounding landscape for the way back from which they came. Some hop on their fixed-gear bikes, some call for cabs, while a few of us hop a fence and cut through the industrial wasteland of a nearby condo&nbsp;development. 
</p>
<p>
The half-built condos tower above us like foreboding monoliths of our yuppie futures. I take a look at one of the girls wearing a bright pink keffiyah and carrying a Polaroid camera and think, &quot;If only we carried rocks instead of cameras, we&#8217;d look like revolutionaries.&quot; But instead we ignore the weapons that lie at our feet – oblivious to our own impending&nbsp;demise.
</p>
<p>
We are a lost generation, desperately clinging to anything that feels real, but too afraid to become it ourselves. We are a defeated generation, resigned to the hypocrisy of those before us, who once sang songs of rebellion and now sell them back to us. We are the last generation, a culmination of all previous things, destroyed by the vapidity that surrounds us. The hipster represents the end of Western civilization – a culture so detached and disconnected that it has stopped giving birth to anything&nbsp;new.

	 I have serious problems with hipster criticism. Sure they party a lot and are over the top trendy, but really I'm not going to start complaining about a youth movement that is--at least in theory--anti-consumerism, American Apparel kind of ruined this ideal though but at least they're fair trade. Also hipsters are  accepting of all races and sexualities. Even the straight guys and girls wear borderline gender bending clothes. I find everyone who criticizes hipsters is either a hipster them self or an asshole who hates on them for all the wrong reasons. I'm totally part of the Indie rock scene in my city though so I guess I'm probably a hipster.. whatever I guess

	I find that a lot of "the scene" is extremely ageist though and it kinda gives the game away, admittedly this is no different to any other youth sub-culture and is understandable to a degree since it's usually our elders that we blame for our current ills and we mistrust them accordingly, but there is a large amount of exclusion - and ridicule even - seen exibited towards older people who may not even be trying to be part of their scene but who still contribute to it, whether it be musically or artistically, or even going as far as to create the venues that become mainstays of that scene, and it makes me wonder whether the seemingly open-minded attitude is also just a studied pose with many people, and an incompletely studied one at that.	<span class="byLine">&#8212; Anonymous</span>

	wait, you mean kids are worried about being cool? When did that happen?

I didn't realize there weren't other subcultures in the world to pick up the slack from several thousand apathetic youths! Now that I know, I'll start calling everyone a hipster without knowing what it means, or knowing them! 

man, I sure hope the kids developing helpful technology, like automated green houses and electric cars, don't wear flannel shirts and smoke parliaments! And I really hope all of the people we hire overseas to hold up our economy don't wear Nike Boots, cause I'd flip a shit! I mean, come on! How can I be thankful for someone inventing renewable energy sources if they shop at American Apparel (TM) ? 

And, gee, i didn't realize the world isn't as globalized as I've been taught during my entire education process, from qualified teachers and professors. Shoot, here I was thinking that other cultures could pick up the slack from our own! 

Einstein wasn't a beatnik. Gandhi didn't shoot heroin and march with protesters in Washington, DC. And Adbusters forgot what country its based on, and what political and economic systems are behind that country (US, democracy, capitalism, respectively--in case you didn't catch that.) 

This article just succeeded in inflating the egos of thousands of readers, by implying that we White, American Youth are the geniuses of our times, and that someone in Italy couldn't possibly create what we could. But, unfortunately (and this is a real shocker,) i've met a lot of kids from places other than the US who have better, more influential ideas than mine. Oh well, they don't count! Because I'm white, and am wearing a pair of Vans, and like music--so, because i enjoy canvas shoes and independent tunes, i guess i can't contribute anything to, well, anything--and shit, since I can't, no one else can either!!!!!!!!!!!!!	<span class="byLine">&#8212; Anonymous</span>

	to preface all of this: i'm a 20-something student, i run in a wide variety of circles (from research labs to art students), and i've got a very full, rich, busy life, which on occasion does intersect with large quantities of hipsters.

there is, and always be a certain idea of "cool" in culture - i'm pretty sure such a concept existed in roman times as much as it does now. back then they had sweet-ass sandals or something, now we got chucks and doc martens. big whoop.

the problem with hipsters is that their coolness relies on an air of apathy. there is no room for passion, for true interest in something, for the flash of complete devotion to a subject/cause/person/whatever. this is the one thing that frightens me the most - its not about what kind pants you're wearing or the kind of wheels that get you around - all that is bullshit when compared to the fact that what has entered into the idea of "cool" is detachment and a self-conscious attitude of "oh, i can't be bothered with this."

nobody is cool enough to be a hipster. considering the state of the world today as an ecological and economic system, i don't understand why anybody would want to try. i think there's lots more pressings things to worry about.	<span class="byLine">&#8212; anon.</span>

	Just relax. If you saw me walking down the street you would chuck one of your precious rocks at me and call me a hipster. I would retaliate by kicking you in the face and telling you to relax. Yes, I would kick you in the face. My jeans are so tight its like wearing nothing at all allowing me fluid movement, enough to reach my leg to you all the way up there on your high horse.

I think a great aspect of hipsterdom is its uniting force. Where I'm from the typical class structure has very much deteriorated from what it was like for my parents.

	Someone may have already said this but...

Anyone seen the UK TV series Nathan Barley? It essentially takes the piss out of hipster culture but complicates it by also making the fun of the scenes critic.

He writes an article called "the rise of the idiots" (starting to ring any bells) proclaiming the shallowness of the urban hipster. Furthermore, the writer is employed by a publication clearly based on Vice. After the article appears he is held up as a hero by the "idiots" he clearly hates so much.
 
What is really funny is that he often comes across as so much more self obsessed than the "idiots" themselves (seeing any more parallels?). 

When I found this article I nearly coughed up my Carlton Draught (a workin' class Australian beer). Is this some kind of postmodern joke. Since when was taking an axe to youth the job of a self proclaimed "counter-culture" mag. 

The day adbusters starts attacking youth culture rather than the million other deserving targets in this world is surely "the end of western civilisation"!

	its funny that so many hipsters um i mean "people" who have read this article are shockingly offended are moved to act by posting comments defending hipsters. This article currently has god knows how many views and 4,148 comments while other more pressing issues are hardly discussed... take the November 2008 article "collectively punished" about the Israeli blockade of the Gaza strip for example has only 17 comments. 

all you hipsters need a hair cut and some normal fucking shoes...

your all too cool for school and it shows.

	all of this is an illusion.
everyone wants to stand out and feel like some kind of innovator.

unfortunately people think there's only two ways to do so.

1. you think your standing out by having the lastest fashions and staying up on new music and art.

or 

2. by denying yourself the material things in #1 and choosing to sit on your computer and blog about how dumb hipsters are.
 
Neither of these is effective, and both are tools for the people with power in this country to segregate our youth and distract our generation from the real issues by giving us someone to hate and put time and negative energy into other than themselves.
none of this is real or valid. lets get off our high horses and get rid of our egos so we can ACTUALLY change something in this world.
no is better than anyone that’s something companies made up to make people buy stuff 
we are all just people and have incredible power in mass so lets focus our energy into something productive instead of hating and judging strangers.

plus bashing people online is for pussies.	<span class="byLine">&#8212; Anonymous</span>

<div class="text">
	Dear Author,

1.) Riding a bicycle instead of driving a car seems to be precisely the type of behavior that Adbusters should be promoting.  As for adding brakes... trying riding a fixie down a hill, or in heavy traffic, and you will understand why they install emergency brakes.

2.) You place to much stock in the value of counterculture.  We are no longer "counterculture." We are the "over-the-counterculture."  Counterculture is dead for a reason.  Because it is bullshit, a complete put-on.  There is no culture to counter.  We are all part of this culture, as are you.   Your cynicism is no different than theirs, just as your moral elitism is no different than theirs.

3.) Did it ever occur to you that a great deal of these so-called "hipsters" ARE working class and blue-collar? Who serves you your coffee?  Who is your waiter? Line cook? Your child's teacher? Your dog-walker?  Grocery store bagboy? Who works at your liquor store?  Who is it that drives your ambulance? Runs your library?  Fixes your bicycle? You should take a good look around you, and ask yourself: What do these people look like on a saturday night, when they are not in their work uniform?   If you haven't noticed, we are in an economic K-hole.  Do you really believe that all of these "hipsters" are privileged?  I'm willing to bet that, more often than not, these people that you are holding to such a high standard of morality, come from pious and simple backgrounds.  Most of the "hipsters" that I know come from working class neighborhoods, with parents who just barely get by.

4.) PBR is cheap!!! Try looking into the real reason that PBR has had such a resurgence lately.  We are talking about a generation, fed up with overpriced over-advertised shit being shoved down their throats, choosing to support a company that provides a solid product at an affordable price.  Very thrifty. It comes down to reverse-marketing. The folks at Pabst realized that, by NOT using overt advertising, they were gaining a solid market-base (namely, the type of hipsters who read adbusters).  So, they ran a grassroots marketing campaign.   Have you ever seen a billboard or television ad for PBR?  No, you haven't.  Hmmm... interesting.

5.) The style comes from thrift stores, garbage-cans and salvo-missions, and recycling.  Of course the corporate world will co-opt and resell the fashion.  they always have.  They've done that with all forms of counterculture.  And yes, some of these kids buy into the hype and spend their money on it.  But not all of them.

6.)  On a related note... wouldn't creating a "unique" and "new" counterculture just inspire more mass-production of countercultural accessories and garb.  At least, by recycling the countercultures of the past into to one mass counterculture, it allows for some degree of recycling within that culture.  Ex:  Girl rummages through moms stuff from the seventies and makes it her own.

7.)  Who the fuck do you think buys this magazine? 

    Generally speaking, I do not consider myself a "hipster." But, I did find this article to be a massive over-generalization of an entire portion of today's youth.  It's naive, boring, rambling, elitist, and pointless.  If anyone should be accused vapidness, it is you.

How old are you that you think that this word, "hipster," has any meaning at all?  Is this a high school popularity contest?  Are these the mean jocks and cheerleaders?  Why do you feel the need to cast judgement?

	I work in a bar in SF and I can't tell you the amount of times I've had people come in and order a PBR, only to be told we don't carry them, but we do have Bud for the same cheap price. They wrinkle their noses and get a more expensive Red Stripe instead. It's not the price as much as they coolness (with maybe some anti-corporateness thrown in there, I agree). 

Unless it's a rock or metal show, in which case everyone wants Bud. It's all about which scene you're in.	<span class="byLine">&#8212; Pop Philosopher</span>

	How has it come to pass that a publication like adbusters would attempt to have something prolific an insightfull to say about youth by scoffing at the way kids dance? I can see this guy out there at some bar, rolling his eyes, saying to himself, "God these kids are awfull, look at that girl, she's wearing frames without glasses. Fucking rich kids.

	hipster is an american word. and i believe its an american meaning. the only people i ever heard using really stereotypical social group words are middle-class americans... 
for example: skaters, ravers, goth kids, emos, hipsters..... i'm sorry ladies and gentlemen but i don't live in a world where we categorize people like that. not because we don't use those words, but because we don't have these throw-yourself-in-a-box lifestyles.

i live in berlin and i don't agree at all with this article.

i agree we are once again in a shift in time, but it's so easy to talk about the past idealistically (whoever wrote this article probably wasn't even alive before the punk years anyway).
we are definitely at the end of an era, a really shitty one it was in my opinion, thanks to your shitty government, and i believe we should revise the last few years and start building better conditions for the ones to come. it seems to be going in that direction. 

but in my opinion, the whole problem with american social identities is exactly this article. it is the whole subject itself. it is talking about it, thinking about it, and making it exist that makes it suck.  

why don't you just skip the subject, keep working on whatever it is you are working on, try really paying attention to things that really matter, like matter itself, and move on with yourself. 

i cannot hear the word hipster anymore. i cannot hear americans talking shit anymore. 
shut up and work.

	Now. 'Tis kay. But I see it this way: Hipsterdom in all its spectre is for youth culture like the paradigm's self-destructive seeds. In matter of style and social activities, everything in this age has been defined and specialized to the max; this might seem like too much of a distracting, individuality-destroyin' ambiance to be comfortable with. And so, individualism, radical thinking, innovation and sense of trascendence arise for those who become truly "aware". We might as social beings indulge into consuming some drugs and go to some club and be vain about ourselves. But we have the power to choose either to make this sort of activities the core of our lives or not.
The point is demonstrated by the mere fact of this kind of theoretical discussions on the internet, which is an informative medium available for almost anyone. All currents of thought are out there.

Me, meselves, would take the most radical form of thinkin'. I would do the Fugazi. I would avoid commercialism biased tendencies in all their shapes, as much as I can. Certain variables of consumerism I might not be able to avoid, since I am an individual immerse in a society of production and demand. Above all, I would make my lifestyle and art (or any individual creation) most congruent to my true self.

Now, this wasn't much a very elegant answer but the point should come through.	<span class="byLine">&#8212; DEWDAZORZ</span>

	I've been living in perhaps one of the main ground zeros of the hipster, the Mission for a long time. I do find truth to this article. First, what I have found strange now that I am in my 30s is not that I feel left behind, but that the younger people haven't really brought anything new to the table, except a lot of drugs. While I might sound like typical of someone my age, in all seriousness the bands we listened to and clothes we wore in the early nineties are not only still relevant, none of it has really gone out of fashion. If you went to a Sonic Youth concert in '92 or '99, the styles and tastes would be very similar to what they are now. Skinny jeans, plaid shirts, vintage glasses, and chucks. The thing that has changed in my opinion is the type of person who is attracted to this scene. Thanks to the advent of Urban Outfitters and Myspace, it's just more prolific and less weird. From my experience, there is a lot more irony, a lot more partying, and a lot less discourse or effort toward any philosophical or political thought. It all feels like it's out of a can. It's a different type of person now and it's something I can't even put my finger on but this article hits it pretty well. The standing around, not cutting loose and dancing, that says it all. There's your revolution. F@#$ing dance for crying out loud.	<span class="byLine">&#8212; Sow</span>

	How bout you guys go back to the important shit, like figuring out how to transcend the market and stuff, instead of passing judgment on a bunch of twenty somethings indulging in their youth. You pass so much moralistic judgment looking behind you, it shows your age. You are an uncreative and mopey quife. Go throw rocks with a pink keffiyah and shut the fuck up or figure out how you and your cronies can up with something slightly more subversive than whining. Your ramblings are western civilization, I look forward to you and your pompous intellectual scheme 'ending' with the rest of the emasculated memories of revolution. Go blow something up you intellectual pussy. 

Here's a pitch for Vice, "Intellectualism: Western Civilization and it's Scheme of Virtual Ideas". Maybe it would suit Vice or Adbusters just as well. Your magazine is an endgame. It's essence is cat nip. 	<span class="byLine">&#8212; AMOK</span>
