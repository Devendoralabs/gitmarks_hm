<h2>Publishing Models for Internet Commerce</h2>
<p><i>by <a href="/pub/au/27">Tim O'Reilly</a><br />
06/19/1995</i></p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>One of the biggest challenges facing the Internet over the next few
years is the need to commercialize its activities in a way that is
consistent with its history and its technology.  In this regard, some
of the most useful economic models come not from telephone service,
cable television, or even the computer industry, but from print
publishing.</p>

<p>Here, there is a similar global information marketplace with low
barriers to entry, participation by millions of players, and a variety
of coexisting economic models, ranging from free information supported
by advertisers or other sponsors, subscriptions, and "by the glass" (or
at least the bottle) information purchase.  This market is further
distinguished by a distinct lack of vertical integration:  that is, the
creation of intellectual property, manufacturing, sales and marketing,
and distribution tend to be handled by separate entities, creating a
rich ecology of entrepreneurial niches for both large and small
players.  Finally, the "editorial act"--the creation of products and
brand identities that stand out from a sea of information based on
distinctive points of view--will be a key to the development of future
information services on the Internet.</p>

</ol>


<h3><a name="CH1">Business Models for the Net</a></h3>

<p>The beauty of the net is its diversity:  tens of thousands of newsgroups
and mailing lists, tens of thousands of Web sites.  No one owns it,
no one controls it.  Barriers to entry are low:  because of the
peer-to-peer nature of the underlying network technology, people
who have access to the net as information consumers potentially
also have access as information providers.</p>

<p>As we all know, though, the net is at a critical juncture,
as big businesses of all kinds eye the net for its commercial
potential.  Will the net of the future have the same kind of
diversity when industry titans want to turn it into a medium
in which consumers do just that--consume, rather than
participate?</p>

<p>It's clear that the net will be commercialized in one way 
or another.  The choice we face is whether we adopt commercial
models that reduce the net's vitality or ones that encourage
it by providing incentives for even more of what it's good at.</p>

<p>As businesses approach the net, we each see it through
the filter of our past experience.  So, perhaps:<p>

<ul>
<li><p>To a cable company, the net looks like thousands of channels
for a couch potato to surf through.  (And certainly early
returns from the Web indicate that there is a market for
this kind of passive infotainment, though I have my doubts
about how long that stage will last.)</p></li>

<li><p>To a software company, the net looks like an opportunity
for an early foot in the door that leads to market dominance
as users standardize on a few well known packages.</p></li>

<li><p>To a big media conglomerate (television, newspapers, book
publishing), the net looks like an opportunity to create
"bestsellers" and dominant brands.</p></li>

<li><p>To a small publisher, the net looks like an unparalleled
opportunity to find and fill real user needs, to talk
directly with customers and to create information products
that serve them.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these models has some validity.  But of course, you
can guess which of them I want to address.  I published
my first books almost ten years ago:  two little 80 page
pamphlets with a print run of 100 copies each.  I now
have over 100 books in print, which collectively sell 
millions of copies a year, and employ nearly 150 people
in book, software, and online publishing.</p>

<h3><a name="CH2">The Business of Publishing</a></h3>

<p>What I want to share with you today are some of the characteristics
of the print publishing market that make me think it provides some
of the best models for the commercial Internet I'd like to see developed:</p> 

<ul>
<li><p><b>Barriers to entry are low.</b>  Especially with the advent of
desktop publishing, almost anyone can produce a book, 
a magazine, a newsletter.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Niches abound.</b>  Over 50,000 books are published each
year in the U.S. alone.  A major bookselling
chain such as Borders keeps literally hundreds of thousands
of unique titles in inventory.  And despite major industry consolidation,
and focus on a small number of bestsellers,
there are still thousands of publishers, ranging in size
from those who publish only a single book to those who
publish thousands.  What's more, there are about 3500 general
circulation magazines and tens of thousands of newsletters
and other limited circulation publications. </p></li>

<li><p><b>So do business models.</b>  Books are sold "by the piece."
They are also available for free in the library, though in limited
circulation.  Magazines and newspapers may be had for free (perhaps 
subsidized by advertising or membership), for a single-copy newsstand 
price, or for a recurring subscription fee.  Prices range
from a few dollars to hundreds or even thousands of dollars
for specialized newsletters.</p></li>

<li><p><b>No one "owns" the market, or needs to.</b>  A bestselling book might
sell a million copies or so.  The largest circulation magazine
in the country, the AARP's membership magazine, has a circulation
of about 7 million, <i>Reader's Digest</i> about 5 million.  No one
else comes close.  It's possible to have a successful book
selling only a few thousand copies, a newsletter a few hundred,
and a four color magazine a few tens of thousands.</p></li>

<li><p><b>The same technology is available to everyone.</b>  No one
publisher has a "proprietary edge."   No one has a proprietary
format.  In some cases (consider Bible publishing), the
publisher doesn't even have proprietary content!</p></li>

<li><p><b>There is a rich ecology of mutually successful players.</b>  
Authors sell to publishers.  Publishers screen material, edit and
produce it to add value, develop a marketing campaign, and build a
network of distribution relationships to get the book to the ultimate
consumer.  Publishers may sell books directly to the consumer, through
major retailers, and through wholesalers to smaller retailers whom I
don't serve directly.  Other wholesalers service libraries and
corporations--some of whom also order directly.  No one has to do it
all, and there are opportunities for many players to work together,
each making a profit by performing services in a value chain that
stretches from the author to the reader.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Access is universal and non-exclusive.</b>  You don't have to 
belong to the local bookstore to shop there, and even if you usually buy
your books there, you can go across the street if Borders or Barnes & Noble
has a better deal.  Distribution is spotty--you can't find 
every book in every store--but with special orders, you can
get virtually anything within a few days.  You don't find many books
that you can only buy through a special outlet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>By now, you're probably getting the drift.  Publishing 
is a commercial market--a multi-billion dollar market--that
looks a lot like the Internet as it is now (absent the transaction
mechanisms), and as we'd like it to remain.</p>

<p>The software industry may support only a few thousand products,
with only a few hundred being really successful.  The television
and movie industries may roll out only a few hundred products
a year.  It may take millions in capital to get a foot in 
the door.  Companies struggle to create formats that will 
lock others out of the market and reduce choices for consumers.
Are these the industries we want to look to when we think
to shape the commercial future of the Internet?</p>

<h3><a name="CH3">What About the Content?</a></h3>

<p>So far, I haven't said much at all about just what it is that
publishers will publish on the net, and the services they will
offer!</p>

<p>Let me start out with a disclaimer:  publishing as a field
has so many niches that any suggestions I make here cover
only a fraction of the possibilities.  It's easy to focus
only on the most visible part of the market--trade publishing--and to
forget vast areas that are invisible to the casual user.</p>

<p>But with that behind me, let me talk about two types of
publications that we've been experimenting with at O'Reilly &amp;
Associates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vertical market magazines</li>
<li>Online reference books</li>
</ul>

<p>We've based our work in these two areas on two distinct but 
overlapping observations about publishing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On the net, "Information is plentiful.  Trust and attention are
scarce."  (David Liddel)  The development of brand identity
is a critical part of publishing success in what you might call
"commodity information businesses" where no one has a lock on
proprietary content.</p></li>


<li><p>A reference work is essentially a "user interface" to a body of 
information.  What does that interface look like online?
How can a publisher who specializes in making sense out of complex
topics do it better on the net?</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>Vertical Market Magazines</h4>

<p>In an information glut, it is not content but context that is king.
Someone chooses the <i>New York Times</i> over the <i>New York 
Post</i> not because of any kind of proprietary lock on content (though to
be sure there is a role for scoops and special features) but rather
because it has developed an editorial point of view that
appeals to a particular class of reader.  In a similar way, there
is an enormous role for the establishment of "information brands"
on the net--publications that have established relationships of
trust with particular audiences.</p>

<p>(An important aside here:  Trademark may turn out to be a far more 
important form of intellectual property protection for the net
than copyright.  An intellectual property-based brand or trademark 
is a kind of "standing wave" through which a changing body
of content flows.  A news magazine doesn't own the news
it reports, it owns its name and the point of view associated
with that name.)</p>

<p>A key part of what we established with <a
href="http://gnn.com/">GNN</a> was a brand and a subscriber
list.  The actual content is valuable--but far more valuable
is the relationship with the people who like the same kinds of
things we like.</p>

<p>This relationship runs all through publishing--and not just
magazine publishing.  Publishing marketing is always affinity
marketing:</p>

<p>"If you liked Steven King's last novel, you'll like this one even 
better."<br />
"If you like Steven King, you'll like Peter Straub."<br />
"If you like Steven King, you'll like these other books from the same 
publisher."</p>

<p>The most successful publishers always create brands whenever they
can.  It's certainly been a major part of O'Reilly & Associates'
success.</p>

<p>For information products, a brand is far more than a trademark,
though.  It must also represent a consistent point of view, a 
consistent selection of information.  The 
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/vi5/">animal on the cover</a> 
alerts a reader to the fact that
he's picking up an O'Reilly book, but it's the consistent
subject matter and treatment that makes many customers buy
everything we publish.</p>

<p>In short, honesty and consistency are a key part of brand
development.  The surest way to dilute an established brand is 
to put it on a product that doesn't measure up.</p>

<p>I think that the importance of brands is already well recognized 
in the Web community,
though often poorly executed, mainly because so many sites are
plowing the same ground.  There's only so much room for "the coolest
site."  Differentiation is key.</p>

<p>When trying to make my mark on the Web, I'd opt for a site with
a narrow focus and an audience that can grow over time, rather
than going for a big splash.</p>  

<p>Even from a pure marketing point of view, a smaller number of
more targetted readers may be worth more than a larger, more
random group.  </p>

<p>A good example of a targetted publication is the GNN Travel Center.</p>

<p>Having established a valued editorial point of view, publications
have numerous opportunities for commercialization.</p>

<p>We originally adopted the advertising model for GNN because the 
technology wasn't there for anything else.  We looked around
at commercial "vertical market" magazines and
newspapers such as <em>InfoWorld</em> and <em>PC Week</em> and realized that 
there were plenty of models in print publishing
in which editorial content is distributed free to
users while being paid for by advertisers.  While Internet
demographics of the kind advertisers depend on are still hard 
to come by, there are still significant advantages on the
Internet:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Advertising is not limited to a single attention-grabbing
headline or page; instead, there is room for extended presentation of
useful information.  And because the reader is free to turn away at any
point, there is a clear incentive to the advertiser to provide
information that the reader really wants.</p></li>

<li><p>There is clear feedback to the advertiser about what "works"
and what doesn't, in the form of access logs.  This feature
tends to drive advertisers toward providing valuable content
rather than hype.  (Unfortunately,
many of the people who followed our lead into net advertising
haven't yet learned that lesson!)</p></li>

<li><p>Because of the limited information available via most
other advertising methods, detailed product information must
be provided "out of band" in a separate information transaction.
Online, this information can be delivered immediately, at
little or no incremental cost.</p>

<p>I think that the potential of the Web not for advertising but
for information <em>fulfillment</em> has yet to be tapped.
When you see Hilton Hotels at a catalog operations conference
along with LL Bean and other direct marketers, you realize just
how much potential there is for industries such as hotel chains,
stockbrokers and others dependent on information fulfillment 
to move online.</p></li>

<li><p>The "information transaction" between advertiser and reader can
culminate in a financial transaction, in which the reader actually
orders (and perhaps receives) the product being shown.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Online Reference</h3>

<p>We actually started our work in Web publishing with a plan
for online books.  However, because the technology wasn't
available at that time for limiting or charging for access,
we took a side trip with GNN into advertiser supported publications.
However, our core business is still based on providing
tutorial and reference materials that make sense out of complex
topics.  With some current projects, we're returning to those roots.</p>

<p>Before I describe those projects, let me say a few words about
the nature of the problem.</p>

<p>Though it has not often been stated this way, what is a nonfiction
book, a vertical market magazine, or a newspaper, but a user
interface to a body of information too large to be contained
in the work itself?  The essential act at the core of non-fiction
publishing has always been the design of information interfaces.</p>

<p>In our computer books, we find the selection and arrangement of
material at least as important as the technical information we
provide.  The way in which we tell the story <em>is</em> the
story.  Even a technical book ideally captures a point of view--in
our case, the point of view of an experienced user "talking straight"
to one who is intelligent and eager to learn.  We use various
techniques to create the effect of a conversation between
the person in the know and the one who wants to be.  What is
that but a user interface to information?  The ranks of less
successful publishers are filled with those who think that all
you have to do is dump out an assemblage of facts.</p>

<p>Now, technologies such as the Web make it possible to
create information interfaces at a much more powerful level.  For
example, rather than
relying on an apparatus such as footnotes or bibliographies to refer
to external sources, an online publication can take the reader
directly to them.  Additional types of data can be woven into
the presentation, and much more sophisticated layering of information
is possible.</p>

<p>While great strides have been made in the development of automated
tools for searching for information, there are also tremendous
resources available the "old fashioned" way, in which someone who has
studied an area in depth creates a managed information space that
selects from, models, and makes accessible the larger universe that
is out there.</p>

<p>In a way, GNN's online Whole Internet Catalog 
is an example of this kind of publication.
We had a kind of epiphany when Pei Wei first built a "demo"
of the Whole Internet Catalog online using Viola 
(a precursor to Mosaic, and the first graphical 
environment for the Web).  This wasn't just a demo. It wasn't just an online
book. It was a user interface to the net itself!</p>

<p>Rather than turning someone loose to wander the Web at random,
the Whole Internet Catalog is an environment for directed navigation.  
Sites are categorized, but more than that, they are evaluated.  If a
site is listed, you know it's worth your time.  (We plan to take
this approach even further in future Web publications.)  Various other
features in GNN serve the same purpose--to provide a more structured,
more informative approach to what is a fairly wild information
space.</p>

<p>But let me come back to online books.  A good example of the
kind of thing we plan to do in this space is found in a project
we're doing to turn our <EM>Encylopedia of Graphics File Formats</EM>
into an online product.</p>

<p>The first edition of this book consists of three parts:
a tutorial introduction to graphics programming concepts,
a reference section consisting of four page abstracts or articles covering
about a hundred odd different file formats, and a CD containing
the full text of the specifications for those formats, plus
sample images, software for converting and manipulating images, and
so forth.</p>

<p>In the second edition, due out this summer, the text of the book
will serve as a hypertext interface to the information on the CD,
plus an expanded and continually updated online center containing
related information.
As someone browses the managed space of the online book we've created,
they are also indirectly navigating the larger information
space for which it provides a front end.  Rather than paging
through thousands of pages of specifications, someone reads the
"Cliff Notes" and dips down when they are at the right point.</p>

<p>When thinking about online books, publishers focus too narrowly
on the content.  Early online products have focussed on searchability
and multimedia as key advantages over print products.  But the Web
shows a third key advantage of an online product:  the creation
of information interfaces.</p>

<p>I like to refer to a non-Web product in this context:  Microsoft
Cinemania.  To a casual eye, this looks like a very similar
product to Encarta, Microsoft's online encyclopedia.  However,
Encarta embodies the old model of the online book:  a bounded
body of information (however large).  Cinemania, a collection
of movie reviews, clips, and backgrounders, cries out to be a
user interface that allows users of an online service to download
the movies themselves.</p>

<p>In the old model, the information product is a container.  
In the new model, it is a core.  One bounds a body of content, 
the other centers it.</p>

<p>I believe that there's a tremendous market for those in the
publishing business to turn their experience in making sense
of complex bodies of information to this new world of online
information publishing.  To me, one of the most exciting things
about the Web, long term, is that it is the first environment
that allows non-programmers to create user interfaces.</p>

<p>In the first stage of online publishing, authors, artists, editors
and publishers could participate only by becoming programmers, or
by assigning rights to their work to software companies.  With
the Web and its successors, by contrast, information professionals
will create independent information products--user interfaces to
information created not with software but with the tools they
are already familiar--words, pictures and other familiar carriers
of meaning.</p>

<p>(An aside to investment bankers:  there was a time when software
was unthinkable without hardware.  The separation of hardware
and software via open systems and the PC standard led to the
creation of a new industry.  The Web's separation of content
creation from software should stimulate the birth of another
new industry, in which online information products 
flourish on an open software platform.)</p>

<h4>Paying for Online Books</h4>

<p>The term "online book" seems to suggest a single purchase,
akin to the purchase of a print book.
However, because the net offers the possibility of ongoing update,
the subscription may be a more appropriate concept.
After all, the book itself is an ongoing service. </p>  

<p>I eventually expect to see standalone online products sold by
subscription;  we're coming very close to the mechanisms needed
to make this widespread and widely accepted.
In the short term, hybrid print/CD/online products
hold a great deal of promise.  
These products allow publishers to take advantage of their
current methods of distribution, plus provide consumers with
a local cache of high-volume data on a CD, relying on the Internet
for access to an even deeper or more current body of information.</p>

<p>Purchase of the book/CD will entitle someone to access to the 
online center for a given period of time.  Gradually, users will
migrate to being direct subscribers of the online service.</p>

<p>Note of course that online products will also continue to be
used for some time as "come ons" for other paying services.  For
example, a major revenue source from our online activities in GNN was
the sale of our printed books.  And an online service like
AOL will doubtless provide many forms of online content as
a way of attracting subscribers who are really paying for 
access not to that particular content, but just to the net itself.</p>

<p>But if there's one lesson to be learned from publishing, it's this:
"Let the hundred flowers bloom.  Let the hundred schools compete."
(Mao Tse Tung)  We are in a period of experimentation.  We know
some things that work; many more are yet to be invented. </p> 

<h3><a name="CH4">Missing Pieces</a></h3>

<p>One of the points I made earlier in this paper is that
publishing (like any successful market) is an ecology, in
which players feed each other in a complex web of relationships.</p>

<p>As an industry matures, you see two countervailing trends:
one is towards differentiation, as certain players specialize
in one layer of the business or another;  at the same time,
there is increasing consolidation, as certain players take a lead
in a particular layer.</p>

<p>Right now, everyone is trying to do it all on the net:  
provide software,
connectivity, content, transaction support, data warehousing,
you name it.  As the Internet matures, I expect to see a lot
of the same kind of specialization occurring as we have in print.  We'll
come to recognize that the roles of author, publisher, manufacturer,
distributor and retailer need not be rolled up into the same package.</p>

<p>(As an aside, part of what created the low
barrier to entry for O'Reilly &amp; Associates in print publishing was the
existence of a lot of infrastructure that we didn't need to recreate.
Few, if any, book publishers in America actually manufacture their own
books any more.  Only the largest sell directly to every bookstore.
Most go through a network of wholesalers. And so on.)</p>

<p>Let me specifically address the issue of distribution.</p>

<p>Everyone's initial thought is that the net
does away with the need for a distribution layer.  After all,
any site is accessible from anywhere else.  This is
clearly far from the case.  First of all, net bandwidth
isn't evenly distributed.  Hosting of mirror sites and
data warehousing are enormous opportunities.  But perhaps
more important than the physical distribution layer are the
mechanisms for "attention distribution."</p>

<p>You can see this very clearly in the development of Web-based
advertising.  I believe that GNN was the first Web site
to use advertising sponsors; in the two years since, we've
seen the market go from incredulity ("You can't do that!")
to arrogance ("Anyone can do that!") to a more mature realization
that while anyone can put up a Web site, not every Web site
will get an equal number of hits.  </p>

<p>When there were only a few hundred or even a few thousand sites
on the Web, all one had to do was to set up shop and let the visitors
come.  With tens of thousands, and soon hundreds of thousands of
sites, it becomes clear that setting up a Web site is something like
setting up a shop on the streetcorner outside your factory.  You may
get some visits from passers-by, and because distance is no object,
you can easily invite in your existing customers, but the rest of
the world may never know you exist.  Companies try to get "word of
mouth" by creating more and more innovative or controversial
come-ons, but that will only go so far.  As the market matures,
you'll see a topography emerge in which certain sites stabilize
as the focus or starting point for a certain type of user.</p>

<p>Many of these starting points will be content-based--the equivalent
of <em>Sports Illustrated</em> or <em>Consumer Reports</em> or <em>The 
New York Times</em>--magazines whose (potentially overlapping)
readership will make them stand out as an advertising crossroads
for sites that want to reach that same audience.  Just as happens
now in print publishing.</p>

<p>But there is also a role for the "newsstand" and the "bookseller."
These terms can be taken both literally and metaphorically.</p>

<p>As a publisher, I get questions from many bookstores about what
will happen to them when publishers are setting up shop directly
on the net.  I ask back, "if I were a customer looking for a book
on a particular topic, do you think I'd rather visit thirty
publishers' Web sites, or a single bookstore Web site such
as <a href="http://www.clbooks.com" 
target="new">Computer Literacy</a>, which
carries books from every publisher and offers commentary and advice
about how they stack up against each other.  Again, think ecology.
There is room for many complementary roles, room for many--symbiotes,
competitors, commensals--at the same table.</p>

<p>The bookstore or newsstand may also be a good metaphor for the role
of online services such as AOL, Compuserve or MSN.  Where an
"online bookstore" might provide context for purchasers of physical
books, an online service should provide context for the many
proliferating online products (both free and paid) that are now being
offered on streetcorners around the Internet.</p>

<p>In many ways, selectivity is the inevitable
"other face" of universal distribution.  When you can
get anything you want, how do you select what you want?
At the end of the day, while a consumer can walk into a bookstore
and order any book in print, he or she typically browses through a
much smaller selection offered by the bookseller.  In fact,
one of the key grounds on which a bookseller competes (other
than location) is the nature of the selection that it offers.</p>

<p>And information has a funny characteristic.  Up to a certain
point, more choice is better.  Then the situation flips.  The
user gets overwhelmed, and less is more.  
Publishing shows us the role not of the gatekeeper (who allows only
certain content to be published), but of
the adviser, whether that adviser is a trusted columnist or
reviewer in a newspaper, or a trusted clerk at the local bookseller.</p>

<p>Understanding this role will be important to the future of commercial online
services.  They currently provide several
services rolled into one:  online access, content, and billing.
As online access becomes a commodity, they will compete there
with a host of internet-only providers; on the pure network
distribution layer, they may all give way to the telephone
companies, for whom they are currently resellers.
But they will retain a major role as organizers of distribution--a
newsstand, if you will, from which readers will select many
popular forms of online content. </p>

<p>This is one reason, despite many misgivings in the online 
community, why AOL is a good fit with GNN.  We share a common vision
of providing context to Internet visitors, rather than turning
them loose to surf alone.  This will become increasingly important
as people behind the leading edge join the Internet.  The
Internet's promise as a global communications medium won't be
realized if it only makes room for the brave and the technically
adept.</p>

<p>The role of online services as consolidators of billing
is also greatly underestimated by many people entering the information
business.  While various forms of e-cash may simplify
the transactions, the data processing load of a large business
built on the back of many small transactions is nothing to
sneeze at.</p>  

<p>In my publishing business, I started out selling direct to
the end user, and this is still a major part of my business.
But many publishers won't sell at all to end users.  They just
don't have the systems in place to handle single copy orders.
It's a heck of a lot easier to send a thousand books to
Borders and get a single check.  (It cuts the other way, too.
A bookstore might prefer to buy from wholesaler Ingram rather
than direct from the publisher, just because they can cut one
order for books from a dozen publishers, and be hit with only
one bill for that order.)</p>

<p>Again, this is a major area where the online services (and other
bulk billers, like phone companies) can exploit some natural
advantages of scale.  One of the reasons for our recent sale
of GNN to America Online was precisely to take advantage of
their ability to manage billing and transactions for a subscriber
base in the millions.</p>

<p>In the past, online services had to be publishers of proprietary
content in order to attract consumers.  In the new world of the 
Internet, they need to realize a new role as providers of
on the one hand, back-end services such as hosting of online content, 
billing, and other related services to publishers, and on the other, of 
navigation, ease of access and other related services to users.
In an open Internet environment, their competitive advantage
won't be to lock in customers to specific bodies of content,
but, much like retailers, to expose both walk-in and regular
customers to a wide range of offerings in a comfortable environment.</p>

<h3><a name="CH5">Concluding Thoughts</a></h3>

<p>What concluding advice might I have for would-be information entrepreneurs?
Here are two core principles.</p>

<h4>Give up the focus on gigantism.</h4> 
<p>The net isn't 30 million
people, it's tens of thousands of overlapping groups
ranging from a few people to perhaps a couple of hundred thousand
at the largest.  As I told one large publisher trying to figure
out what to do about the Internet:  "Yes, there is a billion
dollar opportunity here.  But you're going to find it a few
million at a time."</p>

<p>Think niche.  It's the net's greatest strength.  In <i>The Whole Internet 
User's Guide and Catalog</i>, Ed Krol fancifully describes the 
problem faced by a pencil collector in a small town.  It's
not too likely he can find compatriots.  But on the Internet,
he may just be able to find the odd hundred like-minded nuts.</p>

<p>I can attest to the truth of Ed's analogy.  Along with about
150 other people, I read a mailing
list devoted to the work of Dorothy Dunnett, an obscure Scottish
historical novelist whose stunningly intricate novels 
detail the birth pangs of business in the Renaissance.</p>

<p>This happens to be a free "publication."  But if someone wanted
to put up a Web site with access to some of the historical
documents Mrs. Dunnett uses for her research, copies of museum
portraits of the many real people who populate her novels,
and other background information, I and other readers would
gladly pay a subscription fee, if that's what it took to encourage
the activity.</p>

<p>This is a key point.  So far, the net has served its niches
based on free, voluntary association.  And that takes you a long
way.  But if you want even more, sometimes you have to pay,
and are willing to do so, because you want someone to go that
extra mile that you don't have time for yourself.</p>

<p>Perhaps the work of Dorothy Dunnett is too specialized
a starting point--but the "small end" of publishing is a more
reasonable end for many players to start from than the hope
of launching the next <i>Time</i> magazine.</p>

<p>Returning to my own roots in print publishing, I will point out
that I started out by publishing books on individual UNIX
utilities at a time when any technical publisher who deigned
to do a UNIX book was convinced that the market would only support
broad overviews that would reach the largest number of possible
consumers.  Within a few years, my focussed books were outselling
all the general titles, and changed the nature of technical
book publishing by promoting what had formerly been though of only
as "professional" titles to the general public.</p>

<h4>Don't base your business plan on proprietary advantage.</h4>  

<p>Don't get me wrong--there is plenty of competition in publishing--but
it's all based on an open platform, and innovations always raise the
floor we all dance on.  Look for opportunities to reinforce the
fundamentals of the Internet--participation, access, communication.</p>

<p>There are several different issues here.  First is the familiar
one of bandwidth:  the cable vs. telephony model.  In the cable
model, there's large bandwidth to the consumer, and only enough
coming back to make choices among the publisher's offerings.
In the telephony model, as in TCP/IP, everyone is potentially a peer.</p>

<p>Clearly, there are huge opportunities for phone companies who 
realize where their business advantage lies,
and embrace the Internet wholeheartedly as the natural successor
and extension to the telephone.</p>

<p>But despite the battle (which admittedly has died down over
the past year) between the cable vs. telephony paradigms,
the greatest threat to the original peer-to-peer
Internet is probably the World Wide Web.  While the Web
was originally conceived as a groupware product, the wide
success of Windows-based browsers has created a network
in which a great many of the participants are no longer able to
provide information, but only to consume it.</p>

<p>Returning to publishing for guidance, it's clear that there's 
an enormous role for concentrators, selectors, and promoters of content.    
A good publisher defines itself by what it refuses to publish,
as well as by the value it adds during the editorial process,
and the visibility it gives through marketing and distribution.
But never forget that publishing, at bottom, depends upon authors,
and that the tools of authorship are profoundly democratic.</p>

<p>I am very concerned about the creation of a large Internet population
that can not truly participate in a technology as central as the
Web.  Our development of low-cost Windows servers such as WebSite is not just
a good business opportunity but an essential stake in the ground
for the Internet.  Everyone who has a Web browser ought to have
(or have access to) a Web server.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not just a software problem, but one of
connectivity.  It's my belief that creating demand
for universal access (or as near
to it as we can come) with 7 by 24 online connectivity and
reasonably priced bandwidth increments
will enable an explosion of usage that will take the communications
infrastructure into the next century.</p>
