Now some jealous blogger may target me because their PR is still zero OR how about this SULLIVAN and I&#8217;m very friendly unlike some you may know anyway I do GIVE OUT links to my friends and to be honest any blogger that is working for example my brand new project COMMENT DROP &lt; google it LOL<br /> anyway that site could be accused eventually of being a link farm/ link whatever.

The reason I ask is that I stupidly had links on a good blog (IMHO) w 500 original posts, years of work etc. Fully fessing up to the stupid practice and accepting responsibility, I had assumed the worst that would happen if flagged was loss of page rank, not complete loss of blog (and 3 yrs ot hard work).  Recently, it was deleted by Blogger due to Spam.

So as to not give the wrong impression of your initial assessment, on the links, I agree-I had foolishly accepted and honored annual ad commitments to financial related companies with no realization that it was considered &#8220;spam&#8221;.

I can assure 100% that I have never engaged in scraping other original content. 95% of my content there is absolutely original andnthe other 5% is either guest posts or IRS notices I shared with my readers. This was an IRS notice that is allowed to be republished and I stated in the article &#8220;straight from the IRS&#8221; and linked to an IRS link at the bottom as I recall.</p><p>My content is also syndicated at several major outlets like SeekingAlpha, Yahoo!Finance and others so I can assure you it&#8217;s totally my content.

I can also advertise to people on gambling terms. These changes are because you are a business with shareholders and they demand increase in revenues. But to be frank they are a change of your original ethos.<br /> We, the people who build sites for the web and predominately Google have also had changed our ethos.<br /> You created the SEO industry but its an industry so full of half truths, myth and bluff that its is the 21t Centuries snake oil industry. Thats kinda your fault.<br /> People buy links because it works. Getting the plebs to report on each other is really not a great way to go about this. Its not like your paid link rules are clear, without ambiguity or held equally. Your recent nexus phone giveaway was an example of the grayness of your rules.<br /> Food my friend for thought.</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-486126"> <span class="avatar"><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/9ef11d5ed236a13e38b56108108e392a?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></span> <span class="comment_author">John Anderson</span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-486126" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 3, 2010 at 4:00 pm</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-486126"><p>As a webmaster of 6 years now, I get multiple requests daily from a growing number of fly by night SEO companies, the majority from India but not all.

I wasn&#8217;t participating in any link schemes, and up until that point my site was ranking relatively well. Google Webmaster Tools didn&#8217;t show anything to suggest it was hacked or have any suggestions at all for that matter. The only thing I can think of is the anchor text on the bottom of my clients sites of which all are on seperate IPS, but on the same server. No where in Google guidelines does it say that you can&#8217;t have inbound links from your own sites so I&#8217;m confused as to what might have caused the sudden drop. Would the new algorithm drop my site because I have layered images in the CSS? All the font was visible, and nothing was misleading so I can&#8217;t for the life of me figure out what caused this issue. I sure wish Google would of at least sent me an email in Google Webmaster tools if there was an issue I should be fixing.</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-486679"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://twitter.com/bk_cox" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ce3fec90790f26e6755592dc3b871c30?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://twitter.com/bk_cox' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Brian</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-486679" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 4, 2010 at 1:25 pm</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-486679"><p>@Robert &#8211; this isnt digitalpoint <img src='http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p></div></dd><dt class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-486682"> <span class="avatar"><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/533da152ef0ce9313988b419defa20f1?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></span> <span class="comment_author">Martin Smith</span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-486682" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 4, 2010 at 1:27 pm</a></span></dt><dd class="comment even thread-even depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-486682"><p>I really hope that Google starts taking linkspam more seriously.

(Do you take the site into context or just the spam report?)</p><p>These new alogithms, will they work to automatically remove penalties and is the whole application and removal of the things going to happen faster with caffeine?</p><p>In my industry thousands of hacked servers are used to get sites very decent rankings in weeks but recently you guys seem to be finding and removing them (well done) unfortunately a few established guys have now had there sites linked to by these guys and also &#8216;appear&#8217; to be suffering the same fate. I understand it&#8217;s easy to say you do a lot to stop competitor A from hurting competitor B and the G Mail analogy but there are a couple of differences.. For starters GMail doesn&#8217;t control anywhere near the market share or influence natural serps in a way millions of businesses live on. It&#8217;s not as easy for competitors to spam and report if a mail server is setup correctly.. It&#8217;s also not as public and therefor not as easy for an immoral competitor to reverse engineer.</p><p>I&#8217;m becomming increasingly worried about what a good link is.. Maybe you could define a few parameters or creative real world examples.. Links need to be editorally given I understand that but what if you insist on the alt text and the editor agrees? What if you did this with 1 site, 10 sites or a 1000? What if you have unusual business partners that are from a completely different niche but still generate decent partnerships? What if you offer badges (stickers) on your site and people from all parts of the web link to you (it&#8217;s still editorially given).. Couldn&#8217;t competitors report this? When would a review be spammy? Would a massive company with a million dollar marketing budget that sends out thousands of products and happens to receive a tonne of links be spamming? Are retail sites only supposed to rely upon content when they are not about content and wouldn&#8217;t have to in any other medium. Are business supposed to rely upon non-web means of generating links.. Sorry I could go on and on.. As someone with a small budget and what I would describe as fair means of competing I&#8217;m getting worried about how hard I can push my marketing strategies without overstepping the mark (I&#8217;m suffering from a penalty from albeit stupid mistakes but the above are questions running through my head for what I can and can&#8217;t do in the future)</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-486984"> <span class="avatar"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/a7ca123e242250dcf01bc9b973886b97?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></span> <span class="comment_author">Arizal</span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-486984" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 5, 2010 at 3:38 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-486984"><p>Hi Matt,</p><p>I appreciate Google&#8217;s SE and it&#8217;s ability to deliver good results. I am less thrilled about the company&#8217;s approach to webmasters in the last time. What are you going to do about those &#8220;spammy links&#8221;? Devalue them or punish the target site as suggested by some papers concerned about combating link spam (or as suggested in your very own comments in the WP-footer links discussion with ShyBoy on the Google forum?!)?</p><p>We all know what will happen in such a case and already happened: destroying the competitions link universe with blog commenting scripts, mass-install of free hosted autoblogs linking to the competition and the like. Making a great WP theme with footer links or buying some lame links for the competition will not even be necessary. It will be the cheapest form of SEO ever.</p><p>And I am not so positive as Aaron Wall is, that it will be a matter just to &#8220;small&#8221; sites. I worked with clients operating some of the biggest sites of a country (maybe I currenty work in the wrong one?!). We got a Google Account Manager for each AdSense, AdWords and GAM. But when we wanted to clarify why one of these sites (one of the most read in the whole country!) is obviously somehow penalized &#8211; or at least  in a very strange way under performing &#8211; nobody at Google did bother to even pass a mail to the appropriate team. All we asked for was to explain us your rules in a plain, but clear language so we could comply again with them. And at the webmaster console? Zero feedback and I do not notice a difference to the no feedback policy when working with an average joe&#8217;s site.</p><p>I am skeptical about this &#8220;calling for link spam&#8221; campaign and can hardly imagine that it will do any good.</p><p>Kind regards<br /> Arizal</p><p>(Ps: sorry for not putting my real name to the public, but I do not want to share my experiences to obviously with our competition. Thanks. You got the real name in the Mail).</p></div></dd><dt class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-486985"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://potpolitics.com/2010/03/03/googles-hidden-isosceles-project/" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7c2f16dbf0444a5e07d5dbd8715bdaaf?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://potpolitics.com/2010/03/03/googles-hidden-isosceles-project/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>John Sullivan</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-486985" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 5, 2010 at 3:38 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment even thread-even depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-486985"><p>@Matt Thanks I had that Keyword Luv thing on my Name and didn&#8217;t notice as I hit submit.<br /> Anyway sorry for the trouble hope to spot u @SXSW to say Hello</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-487005"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://www.chicagorealestates.net/" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0a238fa6e3e05a6788c4df9d352bcea4?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://www.chicagorealestates.net/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Brian Nygard</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-487005" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 5, 2010 at 5:06 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-487005"><p>likes &#8220;disavow links&#8221; idea&#8230;</p></div></dd><dt class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-487060"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://www.marketinglawyers.org" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/9c162dde7b9e6903b91207ae160db98c?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://www.marketinglawyers.org' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Davd</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-487060" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 5, 2010 at 6:40 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment even thread-even depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-487060"><p>I think this s great way to keep people honest. Google can not understand the iniquities of every industry. I work in the legal vertical. I&#8217;ll see several hundred page rank passing links from a competitor&#8217;s directory. To Google this would seem fine; however, the links are for practice areas the firm doesn&#8217;t practice in areas they don&#8217;t practice. The only reason for the link is page rank. I will see a page reporting every supreme court decision on a particular day with 3 links at the bottom. No lawyer would search for a case that way. To use Google&#8217;s terms, that page has no value to the searcher. Once again, another page rank passer. I will also see 5 completely unique website sites, but all home page links go to the firm&#8217;s main site. The crawler is seeing something different than the user. This is classic doorway pages. Finding a needle in the haystack would be a major understatement of how hard is it for Google to do this alone.</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-487083"> <span class="avatar"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/688af20c798c2449ba0d2a9773ae5ff2?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></span> <span class="comment_author">Anon</span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-487083" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 5, 2010 at 7:12 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-487083"><p>As I used to be one of the largest contributers to the paid links economy, I feel that I am in an authority position to share my thoughts on this:</p><p>I think this current development in Google&#8217;s algo to combat paid links is probably not necessary. This is because the algo has been recently more effective in combatting paid links and the Vince update was absolutely devastating to SEOs in competitive arenas, including myself. Also, Google&#8217;s stronger attitude in penalising sites recently has also made paid linking seem an even more unattractive option.</p><p>In fact, we&#8217;ve turned out back on paid linking now due to the cost/benefit/risk/reward ratio and are now trying to focus on doing more projects which appeal to the linkerati.</p><p>Watching from the outskirts into paid link land, we&#8217;re seeing the prices that webmasters were demanding are now dropping, as the demand for paid links cools off. Also, because many webmasters now understand that accepting money for paid links is now outside of Google&#8217;s guidelines, they don&#8217;t want to risk a penalty, that makes obtaining paid links an even more difficult proposition.</p><p>To put this in perspective, an individual going out and brokering quality links on semi-decent sites which are not spammy will only achieve and complete around 10-20 link deals a month, which has forced many of the linking teams outside of the western world into the cheap labour markets of the East in order to stay competitive and keep SEO costs within reason. Even so, the aggressive SEO market is taking major strain in terms of trying to stay effective and competitive in price.</p><p>Can we talk in private?</p></div></dd><dt class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-487122"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://www.emailaddressmanager.com" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d36440956c6aa37525ee9ec8d1ed6ad7?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://www.emailaddressmanager.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Bogdan Ionita</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-487122" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 5, 2010 at 8:37 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment even thread-even depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-487122"><p>As others mentioned before, I just don&#8217;t see how Google will be able to prevent competitors from hurting each other with purpose.

But for now, just listen to Matt.  He has made it clear that it is only comment spam if the site owner cannot &#8220;vouch&#8221; for the link, it is not a link farm, domain farm, or using some other nefarious method to manipulate PR and rankings.</p><p>That is the main problem I have is this often dark area of what is and is not spam.  I consider web spam to be porn sites and travel junk.  If I see that on a blog, I know it is spam. But if you put a link to your site and are a socializer like me, it makes sense you want people to know who you are and what you sell.  Doesn&#8217;t it?  I mean isn&#8217;t mixing how we meet and engage in commerce and friendship?

Is that still true?  Seems that twitter and Digg want everything to be &#8220;no follow&#8221; for fear of a problem with Google.  So I am not sure.</p><p>However, I can easily see your competitor telling some wet behind the ears employee at G that all your comments are &#8220;spam&#8221; since they are in &#8220;blog post comments&#8221; and therefore de index you.  That person may make an arbitrary and capricious judgment call that could destroy your livelihood and it is no joke.</p><p>I certainly would like more clarification from Matt, as my whole business is internet based, and DO NOT want to do anything to tick them off!  Get it?  Once in a while Matt will toss out a gem that helps with the never ending and constantly changing puzzle that is the Google algorithm.</p></div></dd><dt class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-490132"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://jamiedolan.com" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/a97dfe84a644c6e3eaf9942669b8375d?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://jamiedolan.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Jamie Dolan</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-490132" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 7, 2010 at 9:17 pm</a></span></dt><dd class="comment even thread-even depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-490132"><p>@panzermike:<br /> &gt;Matt at one time said social media was a great way to get “do follow” links<br /> &gt;back to your site. Is that still true? Seems that twitter and Digg want<br /> &gt;everything to be “no follow” for fear of a problem with Google. So I am not sure.</p><p>Based on the research I have done, the vast majority of these sites (social networking) are nofollow for links you post.  For example; my twitter page is PR6, but as far as I can tell, links from my twitter account do not help my SERP at all.</p><p>Many people have become very dependent on google for their lively hood, either based on SEPR, adwords, or adsence.  Even more disturbing than people losing rank because someone believes they are a spammer is all of the adwords and adsence accounts that got canned in the past couple months.  This did not affect me personally, so I really have no idea what these people did to get banned.  I heard many reports from people where they claimed not to have done anything iffy at all.</p><p>So my questions here is, what are considered the legitimate way to build links now?  Just asking other webmasters for links?  I did that for one site, and it was pretty effective, but it was weeks of writing letters and making calls.</p><p>I&#8217;ve added my sites address to a couple forums that I have been a long time member of, and noticed a boost in results very shortly afterwords, so I know that can help.  Again it is a very limited way to get links, the forums that helped my SERP, I have invested hundreds of hours contributing to those sites.</p><p>So it brings me back to the question, what is it that we should be doing to help promote our site and articles?  Are we just suppose to hope that Google eventually ranks our content well based on how good the content is?</p><p>Jamie Dolan<br /> Neenah, WI</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-490232"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://binaryday.com" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/60723714aba9e066f2b009bb3d3e095f?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://binaryday.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Sita</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-490232" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 7, 2010 at 11:30 pm</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-490232"><p>I think most of us have missed the first line of Matt&#8217;s post. <strong> Google has a new algorithm for spam detection </strong> and they want the spam reports to see if the algo is working as intended.</p><p>That means<br /> <strong> 1.

Also Google ignores people that want to help Google, people that own Google stock and want to see Google do better.  So the people that can help Google the most (people like me) have given up on Google and do not trust Google to do the right thing.  I even have blog posts with very specific examples of what I am saying and Google does not admit nor fix their mistakes.<br /> Go to:<br /> <a href="http://gototom2.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://gototom2.blogspot.com/</a></p><p>When will Google fix the mistakes completely mentioned in this article?</p><p>If you want people to help you more you need to follow up and fix blatant publicly documented mistakes.  Also you can not penalize innocent sites and than just keep asking for more help for you to ignore.  This hurts Google&#8217;s credibility, which is how most of the top experts feel about Google currently.</p><p>I wish I could make more positive comments about Google as I do own Google stock.<br /> On a positive note, it is not too late.  Have your staff focus on the most obvious and blatant abuses and fix all publicly documented Google mistakes, then you will start to win Google supporters and shareholders back and more good experts will want to help you.</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-490973"> <span class="avatar"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/8567530bc3638cfff274becdd8e346e2?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></span> <span class="comment_author">Narendra Pingle</span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-490973" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 8, 2010 at 10:38 pm</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-490973"><p>Matt,<br /> Can we consider the websites which are into reciprocal linking as spam websites? especially when they are blocking those pages from the search engines with robots.txt.</p></div></dd><dt class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-491100"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://www.ozgrid.com" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/18d4fb28a5433418c3a0f9cb5ac85c07?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://www.ozgrid.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Dave (Original)</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-491100" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 9, 2010 at 1:31 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment even thread-even depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-491100"><p>RE: I heard many reports from people where they claimed not to have done anything iffy at all</p><p>Prisons are fully of &#8220;innocent&#8221; people too :O)</p><p>RE: So my questions here is, what are considered the legitimate way to build links now?

In the past couple of weeks my local business center listing was penalized. I knew this because I use to be able to type in denvers insurance in google search, and my listing would come up on LBC. One day, it stop showing up in searches, and the visibility was absolutely horrible. I did some research and found out that my local listing had been duplicated several times. At first I thought it was the web sites i had a listing in (such as denver.com) were duplicating it, in order to put in their website in, so when it was clicked, it would re-direct back to their website.(hijacked listing) Once I thought about it, the listing would be an owner verified listing. These are not. I click of course to that I am the business owner so I can delete the listing. I have came to the conclusion that google is duplicating my listing. I also came to the conclusion, that google penalized my local listing, due to spamming in the maps part of google. What do  i do to stop these duplications? I found 2 again today, and they seem to be popping up every day. Can you please help? How do I stop these duplications? Since then I actually scrapped my old listing and started over.

Do you think they care as long as they are getting the information they want?<br /> 5) Returning sites with the most relevant CONTENT and stop spending so much time worrying about links. It is Google that started this problem by over-focusing on links (yes, I am suggesting that the algorithm is flawed). Google needs to turn down authority and turn up relevance. In this way &#8216;spammy&#8217; (which is not a word by the way, it&#8217;s something used to say &#8216;I don&#8217;t know if this is spam but it looks like it COULD be&#8217;) links would be of far less importance as CONTENT (not necessarily content that thousands of people want to link to) would rise to the top.<br /> 6) To play devils advocate, how you ever considered that shady link building has been good for Google search results? If someone is going through the effort of building or paying for links they obviously care about what they have to offer and target what they have to offer very specifically = better information for consumers (even if it is something that Google frowns upon, like payday loans).</p></div></dd><dt class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-494566"> <span class="avatar"><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7ee77e224bf774af5892a086bbeb47ea?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></span> <span class="comment_author">Frances</span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-494566" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 11, 2010 at 6:33 pm</a></span></dt><dd class="comment even thread-even depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-494566"><p>Seems a bit like Google keep pulling the rug from honest website owners!</p><p>Back when I started my site (2004/2005) I was told in no uncertain terms from white hat SEO companies that it was worth paying for certain links.

There are 100&#8242;s of sites in the farm with different hosts, different IPs, domains registered to the same 4-5 companies, but all with the same structure (to maximize the extent of the spam) and the exact same strange robots.txt.

Is this considered link spam by Google?<br /> 2. Will these &#8220;linkspam&#8221; reports be used to ban or penalize sites from the index in especially egregious cases like this even when coming from a competitor like me?<br /> 3. If the site is not banned or penalized, should I submit another report and maybe request a explanation from Google?</p><p>Feedback:<br /> 1. I had 300 URLs to report (3 per site) but they would not fit in the character limited text field so I submitted 2 separate reports.<br /> 2. It would be good to get some positive feedback (other than &#8220;we got your report&#8221; auto-responder) to know that:<br /> A. something came of our report<br /> B. whether or not the practice reported is &#8220;OK&#8221; or not.</p><p>I would really appreciate a response considering it took me 3 days to gather and submit all the data!

I can see how it may help when large sites are buying links all over the place, but these sites should be on Google&#8217;s radar anyway, surely?<br /> My concern is that smaller sites with heavy competition will end up unfairly penalised. My site got hit with a google penalty about 5 months ago &#8211; and is still penalised! There could have been (as far as I can tell), two reasons for this:</p><p>1. In July last year I ran a competition that relied on people blogging about the competition to enter. This obviously meant I would get a link for every entry. I ended the competition after only getting 2 entries in as many months (!), and asked the entrants to remove their links to my site. I can now see that this violated the Google guidelines (I didn&#8217;t realise it did at the time).</p><p>2. I annoyed a competitior of mine (a simple arguement), and that person told me they would get my site banned from google by spamming my link using automatic tools.</p><p>My guess is that my competitor did exactly that, and then reported my site to Google using a number of anonymous webmaster accounts. (I may be wrong, and the penalty could be 100% my own fault &#8211; I can&#8217;t get the info from webmaster tools to find out).</p><p>But, Matt &#8211; if this is what happened, it seems to me that this new linkspam reporting will only make it easier for this to happen in the future.</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-503463"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://www.hermesmyth.com" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/addf6013b40adf83373487380881b55b?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://www.hermesmyth.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Yuvaraj</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-503463" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">March 22, 2010 at 12:18 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-503463"><p>But still I see most of the SEO companies do paid link building.

Right?</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-517188"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://seofrompoland.com" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/8699808922bc0e9c62dbf4f834a90ad5?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://seofrompoland.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>shpyo</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-517188" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">April 7, 2010 at 1:54 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-517188"><p>Another ethical problem <img src='http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p></div></dd><dt class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-518491"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://samedaystdtesting.com" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/13acc9de2044dfcc8a2481202a65e21b?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://samedaystdtesting.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Tina</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-518491" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">April 8, 2010 at 1:55 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment even thread-even depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-518491"><p>It seems that many competitive industries will have backlashes because of such a policy. It would be easy for a rival business to claim you had link spam just to drive you into the hot seat or block your ability to conduct full out business while under scrutiny of being watch by Google extra carefully for &#8220;suspected activities&#8221; whether real or not. It just feels like it would be too simple for such sabotage to happen. What safeguards are in place under the idea of such a policy to ensure that good businesses regardless of size or industry would not be affected in a negative way due to libel? I hope there is a fair process and thorough review if such a claim comes up against a company.</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-537761"> <span class="avatar"><a href="http://www.myswabi.tk/" rel="external nofollow"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/eaa12e3d53ddba810b60c2e354db89fd?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></a></span> <span class="comment_author"><a href='http://www.myswabi.tk/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Swabi</a></span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-537761" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">April 25, 2010 at 5:54 pm</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-537761"><p>Thanks Matt for sharing this news with us.

Google algo is the best but is not perfect. I&#8217;ll give an exemple of a spam site that uses very simple tecniques and is able to fool G.</p><p>I have a site written in english even though my first language is portuguese. Yesterday, a guy spam commented my english site wih links to his portuguese site. I checked to see if he was having success doing so and was surprised to know that he is able to dominate the serps doing basically spam comments and building related keyword linkwheels. He outranks bigger and better sites doing this. This is his main site:</p><p>criarsites.com</p><p>And these are his support sites with rewritten content from the main one. Notice that for this tecnique to work, you have to buy domains that are on google keyword tool and are related to your main site. You can host it all on the same server as this guy does that and there is no link devaluation because of it.</p><p>montarsite.com<br /> montarsites.com<br /> criarsites.net<br /> criarsites.info<br /> comocriarumsite.info<br /> hospedagemdesites.me<br /> hospedagemgratis.me</p><p>The list goes on with blogger blogs, wp etc. This is just a sample for you guys see that Google algo alone cannot handle even unsophisticated spammers like this one much less the advanced Spammers that don&#8217;t leave that many footprints.</p><p>This type of manipulation  is bad for users because they always have to read the same rewritten content and bad for google that only serves results  from the same author. If G team is asking for the legitimate webmasters to help them, we should do so. Google team is smart enough to know when a competitor is trying to harm a legitimate site. Only you can harm your site, not your competitors.</p></div></dd><dt class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-548956"> <span class="avatar"><img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/9279a8a7dc42d52a4ea56d2670e6e069?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></span> <span class="comment_author">Constantin</span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-548956" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">May 5, 2010 at 11:14 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment even thread-even depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-548956"><p>Does link manipulation count for this?

On the one hand, Google doesn&#8217;t like links that pass PR and apparently has mechanisms in place to stop that.  However, on the other hand, I&#8217;m seeing evidence that paid blog links with keyword rich anchor text is very effective for improving your rankings.</p><p>For example, goo.gl/xcoC1 has very poor SEO, bad page structure, etc., and until recently had very poor rankings.  They have been buying blog links for over a year and now have over 500 paid links out of just over 1,000 total links.  Then, suddenly, over the last couple of weeks, they rocket to the top of the rankings for the all the phrases they&#8217;ve been paying for including #1 for &#8216;rackmount computer&#8217;.</p><p>The blogs with the paid links are either not ranked or have PR=0.  About 15 of the blogs do have some PR.  goo.gl/xcoC1 PR has not changed so it appears they aren&#8217;t gaining any PR juice from these links.</p><p>But in looking at all the factors that might explain their rocket-like rise to #1 ranking, the ONLY thing that explains it are the paid blog links with highly targeted and repetitive keyword rich anchor text.  Wander down the list I provided at <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/thread?tid=49018f5317178182&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/thread?tid=49018f5317178182&amp;hl=en</a> and you can see exactly what keywords goo.gl/xcoC1 bought.</p><p>So perhaps Google is concentrating on not allowing sites to pass PR but doesn&#8217;t have a problem using paid keyword rich anchor text to establish a site&#8217;s keyword focus.  All other things being equal between sites, the one with 500 inbound keyword rich links wins, even though those are paid links.</p><p>There are a lot of people complaining that they report sites that are obviously gaming the index and winning and that submitting Paid Link Reports is a waste of time.  What is going to happen is that people will see that buying links has no penalty and will start to follow the herd just to stay even.  That will kill the PR magic Google bases their entire business model on.</p><p>See the bottom of for more on this subject.  goo.gl/xcoC1 has figured out how to beat the index and are now outranking other more appropriate sites who play by the rules.</p><p>The Paid Link Report and the Spam Report are both pretty lame for reporting sites with hundreds of paid links.  The Spam Report works a bit better but the text box is limited to about 60 or so site addresses.  Would be nice to extend that box size or provide for attaching a file.  You might get some more appropriate reporting if you really want it.</p><p>Thanks,<br /> David</p></div></dd><dt class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-684411"> <span class="avatar"><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/019a78b0d094ade68cb76c6b351af816?s=44&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /></span> <span class="comment_author">David</span> <span class="comment_time"><a href="#comment-684411" title="Permalink to this comment" rel="nofollow">December 16, 2010 at 8:29 am</a></span></dt><dd class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"><div class="format_text" id="comment-body-684411"><p>Sorry, left out a link in the next to bottom paragraph.
